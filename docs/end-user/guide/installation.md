# Installation

Most database tooling ships with a runtime to install, a service to configure, and a license server to point at. SchemaSmith ships as three self-contained executables. Pick the channel that matches your environment and one command later you have `schemaquench`, `schematongs`, and `datatongs` on your PATH -- Windows, Linux, or macOS, no .NET runtime, no system dependencies, no fuss.

## Pick Your Path

| Platform | Recommended | Alternatives |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Windows | `choco install schemasmith` | Manual ZIP download |
| Debian / Ubuntu | `.deb` package | `install.sh`, manual `.tar.gz` |
| RHEL / Fedora / Amazon Linux | `.rpm` package | `install.sh`, manual `.tar.gz` |
| Other Linux | `install.sh` | Manual `.tar.gz` |
| macOS | `install.sh` | Manual `.tar.gz` |

Every channel installs the same three CLI commands and the same self-contained binaries. The choice is logistics -- what fits your environment's policies, your update workflow, your CI runners. Pick once and the channel handles installs and upgrades from there.

## Windows: Chocolatey

```powershell
choco install schemasmith
```

One command, three CLIs, signed binaries embedded. No .NET runtime, no checksum files to maintain. The package on the [Chocolatey community feed](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/schemasmith) is named `schemasmith` and includes `schemaquench.exe`, `schematongs.exe`, and `datatongs.exe`. Upgrades flow through `choco upgrade schemasmith` like any other Chocolatey package.

Every release republishes automatically when GitHub publishes the corresponding tag, so the version on Chocolatey tracks the version on the GitHub release page within minutes.

## Debian and Ubuntu: .deb

Download the `.deb` for your architecture and install with `dpkg`. Replace `v2.0.0` and the version in the filename with the release you want -- the [latest release page](https://github.com/Schema-Smith/SchemaSmith/releases/latest) lists what's available.

```bash
wget https://github.com/Schema-Smith/SchemaSmith/releases/download/v2.0.0/schemasmith_2.0.0_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i schemasmith_2.0.0_amd64.deb
```

Binaries land under `/usr/lib/schemasmith/` with symlinks in `/usr/bin/` so `schemaquench`, `schematongs`, and `datatongs` are immediately on PATH. Zero declared package dependencies -- the binaries are fully self-contained and bundle their own ICU runtime alongside the executables, so they work on minimal containers and hardened distros that ship without `libicu`.

Both `amd64` and `arm64` builds are published with every release. Use `schemasmith_<version>_arm64.deb` on ARM hosts.

## RHEL, Fedora, and Amazon Linux: .rpm

Same idea on RPM-based distros:

```bash
wget https://github.com/Schema-Smith/SchemaSmith/releases/download/v2.0.0/schemasmith-2.0.0.x86_64.rpm
sudo rpm -i schemasmith-2.0.0.x86_64.rpm
```

Layout matches the `.deb` package -- binaries under `/usr/lib/schemasmith/`, symlinks in `/usr/bin/`, no system dependencies. Both `x86_64` and `aarch64` builds are published per release. Works on Fedora, RHEL/CentOS Stream, Amazon Linux 2023, and any other distro that supports `rpm -i`.

## Linux and macOS: install.sh

The universal Unix path. One command, any glibc-based Linux distro, any modern macOS, both `x64` and `arm64`:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://schemasmith.com/dl/install.sh | sh
```

`install.sh` detects your OS and architecture, resolves the latest release without a GitHub API token, downloads the matching `.tar.gz` bundle, verifies SHA-256 against the release manifest, and installs the three CLI commands onto your PATH. The script is POSIX `sh` -- no bash-isms -- so it runs on whatever shell your container or distro happens to ship.

By default it installs to `/usr/local/bin` if you run it as root and `~/.local/bin` otherwise. Two environment variables let you override:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `INSTALL_VERSION` | latest release | Pin to a specific version (e.g., `2.0.0`) |
| `INSTALL_DIR` | as above | Custom install path |

Pin a version and target a custom directory in one go:

```sh
INSTALL_VERSION=2.0.0 INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/tools sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://schemasmith.com/dl/install.sh)"
```

When the install directory is not on your `$PATH`, the script prints shell-specific PATH-fixup instructions before exiting -- `export` lines for bash and zsh, `fish_add_path` for fish -- so you can paste once and move on.

## Manual Download

When policy or network constraints rule out the curl-pipe path, download the bundle directly. Linux and macOS bundles are `.tar.gz`; Windows bundles are `.zip`.

```bash
gh release download v2.0.0 --repo Schema-Smith/SchemaSmith --pattern 'SchemaSmith-2.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz'
tar -xzf SchemaSmith-2.0.0-linux-x64.tar.gz
for tool in SchemaQuench SchemaTongs DataTongs; do
    lower=$(echo "$tool" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
    sudo install -m 0755 "$tool" "/usr/local/bin/$lower"
done
```

The rename to lowercase matches the `schemaquench` / `schematongs` / `datatongs` command names the other channels install. PascalCase invocation also works on case-sensitive filesystems if you'd rather keep the binaries' original names.

On Windows:

```powershell
gh release download v2.0.0 --repo Schema-Smith/SchemaSmith --pattern 'SchemaSmith-2.0.0-win-x64.zip'
Expand-Archive SchemaSmith-2.0.0-win-x64.zip -DestinationPath C:\Tools\SchemaSmith
# Add C:\Tools\SchemaSmith to PATH via System Properties or:
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('Path', $env:Path + ';C:\Tools\SchemaSmith', 'User')
```

The available RIDs are `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `osx-x64`, `osx-arm64`, `win-x64`, and `win-arm64`. Pick the one that matches your target.

> **Note:** `install.sh` does the same job with one fewer step on Linux and macOS. Reach for manual download when policy or network constraints rule out the curl-pipe pattern, when you're staging the binaries into a custom layout (CI artifact caches, container images, air-gapped mirrors), or when you want to verify checksums by hand before extracting.

## Verifying Your Install

Two checks anyone can run on any release.

### SHA-256 verification

Every release publishes a single `SHA256SUMS` file alongside the artifacts. The `.deb`, `.rpm`, manual `.tar.gz`, and Windows `.zip` paths are exactly where this matters -- `install.sh` runs the same check automatically.

```bash
gh release download v2.0.0 --repo Schema-Smith/SchemaSmith \
    --pattern 'SHA256SUMS' --pattern '*.tar.gz' --pattern '*.deb' --pattern '*.rpm'
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS                    # Linux
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS                # macOS
```

The `-c` flag fails loudly if any line in the manifest doesn't match the local file. A mismatch is a security incident -- re-download from a clean network or open an issue.

### Authenticode signing

Every `.exe` in a Windows release is signed via Azure Trusted Signing. Chocolatey installs already-signed binaries, but the manual ZIP path is where this check earns its keep:

```cmd
signtool verify /pa /v SchemaQuench.exe
signtool verify /pa /v SchemaTongs.exe
signtool verify /pa /v DataTongs.exe
```

`signtool` ships with the Windows SDK. A successful verify confirms the signature chains to a Microsoft-trusted root and the binary hasn't been altered since signing.

## Per-Platform Notes

> **Windows:** SmartScreen warnings are eliminated by Authenticode signing on every release. If you encounter "Windows protected your PC" on a pre-release or unsigned development build, click "More info" then "Run anyway." Signed v2.0.0+ releases will not trigger this prompt.

> **Linux PATH:** `install.sh` prints shell-specific PATH-fixup instructions when `INSTALL_DIR` is not on `PATH` -- bash/zsh `export` lines, fish `fish_add_path`. The `.deb` and `.rpm` packages install symlinks in `/usr/bin/` so `PATH` works automatically. Manual `.tar.gz` extraction is where `PATH` guidance matters most: append `export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/install/dir"` to your shell rc, then `source` it or open a new terminal.

> **macOS Gatekeeper:** `curl`-downloaded files don't carry the `com.apple.quarantine` xattr, so Gatekeeper typically does not interfere with `install.sh` or manually-downloaded `.tar.gz` archives. If you see "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified," strip the quarantine attribute: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/binary`. Apple Developer ID signing and notarization are on the post-v2 roadmap; once they land this workaround disappears.
