# Working with Your Team

Schema packages are files. That means your database changes live in the same workflow your code already uses -- branches, pull requests, reviews, approvals, full history. No separate migration chains, no deployment scripts maintained by hand, no hoping that staging matches production.

This chapter is about the process that keeps your team moving fast without breaking things. You've already learned how to [define your schema](04-defining-your-schema.md). Now it's time to fortify your development process -- making collaboration natural, reviews meaningful, and deployments predictable.

## Source control patterns

Schema packages work with git exactly the way your application code does. Branching, merging, pull requests, full history -- nothing special required.

**Branching works naturally.** Create a feature branch, add your table, modify your procedures, commit, push. Another developer does the same on their branch. Git handles the merge.

**Merge conflicts are simpler.** Two developers adding different columns to the same table? In JSON, they're adding entries to the `Columns` array -- git auto-merges cleanly in most cases, and when it does conflict, the resolution is obvious (keep both entries). In migration scripts, two developers touching the same table means two separate ALTER scripts with sequence numbers that may collide, and the reviewer has to verify both scripts compose correctly.

**History tells a real story.** Every commit describes a change to the declared state of your schema. Six months from now, `git log` shows you exactly when `LoyaltyTier` was added, who added it, and what the table looked like before and after. With migration scripts, you see that someone ran an ALTER -- but reconstructing the full table state at any point requires replaying every migration in sequence.

This is where schema-as-files really shines. Your schema evolves in pull requests, with reviews, approvals, and a full history -- exactly like your application code already does. The workflow is identical across **SQL Server**, **PostgreSQL**, and **MySQL** -- one repository can host products targeting any mix of platforms, all reviewed the same way.

## Code review with state-based diffs

Pull requests become genuinely readable when your schema is declared as state. Here's what a PR diff looks like when someone adds a column to a table:

```diff
  "Columns": [
    ...
+   {
+     "Name": "[LoyaltyTier]",
+     "DataType": "NVARCHAR(20)",
+     "Nullable": true,
+     "Default": "'Standard'"
+   },
    ...
  ]
```

A reviewer sees immediately: "This adds a nullable LoyaltyTier column with a default of 'Standard'." No need to mentally execute an ALTER script to figure out the end state. The intent is right there.

Compare that to reviewing a migration script:

```sql
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Customers] ADD [LoyaltyTier] NVARCHAR(20) NULL
    CONSTRAINT [DF_Customers_LoyaltyTier] DEFAULT ('Standard');
```

The migration gives you less context. You see the change but not the table it lives in. Is this column next to related columns? Are there indexes that should cover it? You have to open the full table definition separately to know. With the JSON diff, the whole table is right there.

This is the collaboration unlock. Reviewers see table design, not procedural mutation. They can evaluate whether the column belongs, whether the data type is right, whether the default makes sense -- all from the diff itself. The review conversation shifts from "does this script execute correctly?" to "is this the right design?"

## Team collaboration patterns

Here's a typical workflow for a team using SchemaSmith. Notice how each person focuses on their part, and the tooling handles the rest:

1. **Developer** creates a feature branch and adds a `[LoyaltyPoints]` column to the Customers table JSON.
2. **Developer** adds a stored procedure `dbo.CalculateLoyaltyPoints.sql` in the `Procedures/` folder.
3. **Developer** runs SchemaQuench against their local database to verify the changes quench cleanly.
4. **Developer** opens a pull request. The diff shows exactly one new column and one new procedure.
5. **DBA** reviews the full table structure in the PR diff -- the whole file is right there, with indexes and foreign keys in context.
6. **Reviewer** approves. The branch merges.
7. **CI/CD** quenches the package to staging using SchemaQuench. Same package, same command.
8. **Release manager** quenches to production using SchemaQuench in WhatIf mode first, reviews the generated SQL, then runs the real deployment.

Nobody wrote a deployment script. Nobody maintained a migration chain. Nobody worried about whether staging and production are at the same migration version. The same package deploys everywhere, and SchemaQuench computes the right delta for each target. You decide what the schema looks like; the forge makes it happen.

## WhatIf mode as your safety net

WhatIf mode is the preview button for your database. Run it before every deployment -- especially production. Boring deployments are the goal, and WhatIf is how you keep them boring.

```bash
SmithySettings_WhatIfONLY=true SchemaQuench
```

SchemaQuench does everything it normally does -- connects to the target database, computes the delta between the declared state and the current state, generates the DDL -- but stops short of executing. The generated SQL is written to log files in the working directory so you can review every statement.

Build this into your workflow:

- **Development:** Optional. Quench directly if you're comfortable.
- **Staging:** Recommended. Review the WhatIf output to catch surprises before they hit production-like data.
- **Production:** Non-negotiable. Always WhatIf first. Read every line of generated SQL. Then quench.

The cost is one extra command. The benefit is never being surprised by what a deployment does to your production database.

## Reviewing schema changes in context

The PR diff is often enough on its own -- the whole table is right there in the file. But sometimes you want to look at the *shape* of a table rather than scroll through 200 lines of JSON to find one column. Your IDE already gives you that: collapse the columns you don't care about, expand the ones you do, use the outline view to jump to indexes or foreign keys. The file is designed to be readable at any level of zoom.

A few practices that help teams review efficiently:

- **Open the full table file alongside the diff.** Most PR review tools let you view the whole file in one pane and the diff in another. That way you see the new column *and* the rest of the table at once.
- **Search the package for references.** Renaming a column? Grep the whole package for the old name. JSON, SQL, everywhere it appears -- no hidden references in a binary file somewhere.
- **Lean on the `.json-schemas/` files.** SchemaTongs writes JSON Schema validation files on the fly that your IDE will use automatically. You get autocomplete, type checking, and inline errors while you're editing table JSON. Bad data types, misspelled property names, missing required fields -- caught at the editor before they hit a pull request.
- **Use `ShouldApplyExpression` in diffs to communicate intent.** When someone sees `"ShouldApplyExpression": "'{{Table.Environment}}' = 'Production'"` on an index, they immediately understand "this index exists in prod only." Fewer "why does this only exist in X environment?" questions in code review.

The review conversation stays focused on the right questions: is this the right design, is this the right column type, does this index cover the right workload. Not "does this script execute correctly?"
