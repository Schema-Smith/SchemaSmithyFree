# Edge Cases and Escape Hatches

Most of the time, SchemaSmith's [state-based approach](03-core-concepts.md#state-based-vs-migration-based) handles everything. You declare the desired state, quench, and the tooling figures out the diff. But some situations are inherently imperative -- data transforms, rename operations, dependency tangles, version constraints. For those, SchemaSmith provides deliberate escape hatches. You won't need these every day, but when you do, here's exactly how to reach for them. These apply across **SQL Server**, **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and **MariaDB** with minor syntax differences noted where they matter.

## Migration scripts

State-based deployment excels at structural changes: add a column, change a data type, create an index. But some operations require explicit steps that can't be inferred from a before-and-after comparison. Splitting a table in two. Backfilling a new column from existing data. Running a one-time data cleanup. These are migration script territory -- the escape hatch for when the declarative approach needs a hand.

### How tracking works

Migration scripts live in script folders assigned to any of the migration slots. SchemaQuench tracks each script in a `CompletedMigrationScripts` table using the script's relative path as the key. Once a script runs successfully against a database, it won't run again on subsequent deployments.

This makes migration scripts safe to leave in your schema package permanently. They serve as a historical record of imperative changes -- a built-in audit trail that stays with your project.

### The four migration slots

Migration scripts run at specific points in the deployment sequence. Choose the slot that matches when your script needs to execute:

| Slot | Default folder | Runs... |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Before** | `Before Scripts/` | Before any object scripts. Use for data transforms that must happen before schema changes. |
| **BetweenTablesAndKeys** | declare via `ScriptFolders` | After tables are created/altered but before foreign keys and indexes. Use when you need tables to exist but constraints would block your operation. |
| **AfterTablesScripts** | declare via `ScriptFolders` | After tables, keys, and indexes are complete. Use for data migrations that depend on the full table structure being in place. |
| **After** | `After Scripts/` | After all object scripts (views, procedures, triggers, etc.) have run. Use for final cleanup or validation. |

`BetweenTablesAndKeys` and `AfterTablesScripts` aren't in the default folder set -- declare them via `Template.ScriptFolders` when you need them. The slot names stay the same; only the folder paths are yours to choose.

Scripts within each slot run in alphabetical order by filename. A common convention is to prefix with a sequence number:

```
Before Scripts/
  001_BackfillStatusColumn.sql
  002_SplitAddressTable.sql
After Scripts/
  001_CleanupOrphanedRecords.sql
```

### The [ALWAYS] suffix

Most migration scripts should run once. But some need to run on every deployment -- reseeding reference data, refreshing permissions, rebuilding certain configurations. Add `[ALWAYS]` to the filename:

```
Before Scripts/
  001_SeedReferenceData [ALWAYS].sql
  002_RefreshPermissions [ALWAYS].sql
```

The `[ALWAYS]` marker is case-sensitive and must be uppercase. It must appear at the end of the filename (before the `.sql` extension).

### Escape hatch, not default workflow

Reach for migration scripts when state-based can't express what you need. If you find yourself writing migration scripts for routine schema changes, step back -- the declarative approach can almost certainly handle it. The goal is a schema package where the JSON and SQL files describe the target state, with migration scripts reserved for the genuinely imperative operations. Keep the escape hatch for when you truly need it.

## Table and column renames via OldName

Renaming is the classic case where state-based falls short. If you change a table name from `CustomerOrders` to `Orders` in your JSON, SchemaSmith sees "drop `CustomerOrders`, create `Orders`" -- losing all your data. The `OldName` property bridges that gap, preserving your data through the rename.

### Renaming a column

Suppose you need to rename the `Qty` column to `Quantity` on your `OrderLines` table.

**Step 1: Update the column definition and set OldName.**

```json
{
  "Name": "Quantity",
  "DataType": "INT",
  "Nullable": false,
  "OldName": "Qty"
}
```

**Step 2: Quench.**

SchemaSmith sees `OldName: "Qty"` on the column named `Quantity` and executes a rename (SQL Server `sp_rename`, PostgreSQL `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME COLUMN`, MySQL `ALTER TABLE ... CHANGE COLUMN`) instead of a drop-and-recreate. Your data stays intact. Any `Extensions` metadata attached to the column follows the rename automatically thanks to the `OldName` fallback in the preservation pass.

**Step 3: Verify and clean up.**

After the deployment succeeds and all environments have been updated, remove the `OldName` property:

```json
{
  "Name": "Quantity",
  "DataType": "INT",
  "Nullable": false
}
```

Leaving `OldName` in place after all environments have been renamed is harmless but unnecessary. Cleaning it up keeps your schema package tidy.

### Renaming a table

The same pattern works at the table level. In the table's JSON file:

```json
{
  "Name": "Orders",
  "OldName": "CustomerOrders",
  "Columns": [ ... ]
}
```

Quench, verify, remove `OldName`. The workflow is identical.

## RunScriptsTwice -- idempotency testing

Cross-dependencies between object scripts (views, functions, stored procedures) are already handled by SchemaQuench's built-in [dependency retry loop](../reference/schemaquench.md#dependency-retry-loop) -- it runs scripts, collects failures, and retries until all succeed or no progress is made. `RunScriptsTwice` isn't about dependency resolution. It's about **idempotency testing**.

When `RunScriptsTwice` is enabled, SchemaQuench runs the entire set of object scripts twice in succession. Both runs must succeed. This answers the question: "Can my `[ALWAYS]` scripts and object scripts run again safely without breaking?" If a script fails on the second run, you have found a bug before it reaches production.

```json
{
  "RunScriptsTwice": true
}
```

**When to use it:**

- **CI pipelines** -- Verify that `[ALWAYS]` scripts are truly idempotent. If a script fails on the second run, you have caught an idempotency bug.
- **Local development** -- Enable when authoring `[ALWAYS]` scripts to verify idempotency as you write them.
- **Not for production deployments** -- It doubles the execution time for the object script phase with no production benefit. It's a testing tool.

> See [SchemaQuench Reference -- RunScriptsTwice](../reference/schemaquench.md#runscriptstwice) for the full configuration details.

## Deploying across engine versions

Declare `MinimumVersion` in `Product.json` to set the version floor for a product. SchemaQuench detects each target's version before deployment begins -- if any target is below the floor, the run aborts cleanly with a diagnostic naming the offending servers. For targets that meet the floor, SchemaSmith adapts the DDL it generates to match the engine version automatically. You deploy the same package to older and newer targets; SchemaSmith picks the right form for each.

> See [SchemaQuench -- Engine Version Compatibility](../reference/schemaquench.md#engine-version-compatibility) for the full pre-flight behavior, version-adaptive code generation cases, and the supported engine floors. See the [Schema Packages Reference](../reference/schema-packages.md#productjson) for accepted `MinimumVersion` value formats.

## Orphan handling strategies

When SchemaTongs casts your database schema, it may find objects on the server that don't exist in your schema package -- views someone created manually, tables from an old feature, procedures that were never removed. These are orphans. SchemaTongs offers three strategies for dealing with them:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `Detect` | Reports orphaned objects in the extraction log. No files are created or deleted. Default. |
| `DetectWithCleanupScripts` | Reports orphans and generates DROP scripts for review. You decide which scripts to keep and execute. |
| `DetectDeleteAndCleanup` | Reports orphans, generates DROP scripts, and removes the orphaned files from your schema package automatically. |

**Configure it in your SchemaTongs settings:**

```json
{
  "OrphanHandling": { "Mode": "Detect" }
}
```

Start with `Detect` to understand what is out there. Move to `DetectWithCleanupScripts` when you're ready to act but want manual review. Use `DetectDeleteAndCleanup` only when you trust the extraction and want a fully clean schema package. You control the pace.

> For the complete extraction configuration, see [SchemaTongs Reference](../reference/schematongs.md).

## Complex type handling in DataTongs

DataTongs generates sync scripts from live data. Most column types serialize to JSON naturally, but a few require special handling. DataTongs manages all of these automatically -- no configuration needed. A quick reference of what it handles and what it skips on each platform.

**SQL Server:**

- **Geography / Geometry** -- Stored as Well-Known Text (WKT) with the SRID preserved separately. Reconstructed on import via `geography::STGeomFromText()`.
- **HierarchyID** -- Canonical string representation round-trip.
- **XML** -- Cast to `NVARCHAR(MAX)` for JSON serialization, with schema collection bindings preserved in the generated script.
- **NTEXT / TEXT / IMAGE** -- Legacy LOB types cast to modern equivalents for serialization.
- **Identity columns** -- Detected automatically; `SET IDENTITY_INSERT ON/OFF` wraps the merge.
- **Computed columns** -- Auto-excluded from SELECT and INSERT.
- **ROWGUIDCOL columns** -- Excluded from UPDATE.
- **Excluded entirely with a warning:** `sql_variant`, `rowversion`, `timestamp`.

**PostgreSQL:**

- **JSON / JSONB** -- Round-tripped as JSON.
- **Generated columns** -- Auto-excluded.
- **Excluded with a warning:** `tsvector`, `tsquery`, `money`, geometric types (`box`, `circle`, `line`, `lseg`, `path`), user-defined composite types.

**MySQL:**

- **Generated / virtual columns** -- Auto-excluded.
- **Spatial types** -- Basic WKT support.
- **TEXT / BLOB families** -- Supported via string and binary literals.

## Filesystem-illegal characters

Every database engine allows characters in object names that filesystems don't -- colons, asterisks, question marks, angle brackets, pipes, and others. When SchemaSmith writes files for objects with these characters, it encodes them using percent-encoding (the same scheme used in URLs).

For example, a view named `Sales:Summary` becomes the file `Sales%3ASummary.sql`. A table in a schema with a trailing space becomes `MySchema%20`. SchemaSmith decodes these names automatically when reading files back, so the round-trip is transparent.

The encoded characters are: `\`, `/`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`, and the `%` sign itself. Leading and trailing spaces and dots are also encoded since some filesystems silently strip them. Windows reserved names (`CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1`-`COM9`, `LPT1`-`LPT9`) receive encoding on their first character to avoid filesystem conflicts.

You'll rarely need to think about this. It matters most when you're searching your schema package for an object with unusual characters in its name -- look for the percent-encoded version.

## Custom connection properties

Modern database configurations often require additional connection string parameters -- TLS settings, read-intent routing, encryption modes, SSL mode, character sets. Rather than building a custom connection string, SchemaSmith supports a `ConnectionProperties` dictionary in the target configuration. Each key-value pair is appended to the underlying driver's connection string.

**SQL Server:**

```json
{
  "Target": {
    "Server": "myserver.database.windows.net",
    "User": "deploy_user",
    "Password": "s3cret",
    "ConnectionProperties": {
      "TrustServerCertificate": "True",
      "Encrypt": "True",
      "ApplicationIntent": "ReadWrite",
      "Connection Timeout": "60"
    }
  }
}
```

**PostgreSQL:**

```json
{
  "Target": {
    "Server": "postgres.internal",
    "User": "deploy",
    "Password": "s3cret",
    "ConnectionProperties": {
      "SslMode": "Require",
      "Pooling": "True",
      "Timeout": "30"
    }
  }
}
```

**MySQL:**

```json
{
  "Target": {
    "Server": "mysql.internal",
    "User": "deploy",
    "Password": "s3cret",
    "ConnectionProperties": {
      "SslMode": "Required",
      "ConnectionTimeout": "30",
      "AllowPublicKeyRetrieval": "True"
    }
  }
}
```

Each platform's supported keys come straight from its official client library (`Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`, `Npgsql`, `MySqlConnector`). SchemaTongs uses the same structure under its `Source` configuration section.

## Managing indexes you don't own

Some databases aren't yours to ALTER. A database receiving replicated data is owned by the producer; you can tune indexes for your query patterns, but you can't touch the table structure. A third-party product installs its own schema; you need a supplementary index or a custom view to make it perform, but modifying the vendor's tables isn't an option.

`IndexOnlyTableQuenches` is the escape hatch. Set it to `true` on a template and SchemaQuench shifts into index-only mode for that template: it skips table creation, column changes, foreign keys, and check constraints entirely -- and if a table in your JSON doesn't exist on the target, it's silently skipped rather than created. What it keeps managing: indexes, statistics, XML indexes, full-text indexes. Scripted objects (procedures, views, functions) still deploy as usual, so you can ship custom views and stored procedures alongside your supplementary indexes.

```json
{
  "Name": "ReplicaConsumerIndexes",
  "IndexOnlyTableQuenches": true
}
```

**Two use cases to reach for this:**

- **Replicated databases.** The replica is indexed for the producer's write workload. You want indexes tuned for your read patterns -- reports, dashboards, ETL queries -- without touching the replicated table structure. `IndexOnlyTableQuenches` manages your supplementary indexes across every deployment without ever attempting a structural change the replica won't accept.
- **Third-party products.** You can't ALTER the vendor's tables, but you can add indexes to improve your usage. Put your index definitions in a template with `IndexOnlyTableQuenches`, and SchemaSmith manages those objects cleanly alongside your own schema.

This works across SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB -- wherever you can add indexes to tables you don't control, SchemaQuench manages them.

> **Note:** `IndexOnlyTableQuenches` is a template-level flag (default `false`). Each template in your product runs independently, so you can mix an index-only template for the third-party schema alongside a normal template for your own tables, all in one product.

> For the full property description, see [Schema Packages Reference -- Template.json](../reference/schema-packages.md#templatejson). For the quench-sequence detail of what runs and what's skipped, see [Database Quench Sequence](../reference/schemaquench.md#database-quench-sequence).

## The adoption approach

Multiple settings in SchemaSmith share the same story: **start conservative, align in stages, enforce once you're ready.** Whether it's indexes, fill factors, table drops, or the whole schema adoption journey -- the pattern is the same.

### Why big-bang alignment fails

Attempting to bring everything into alignment in a single deployment is one of the most common mistakes teams make. The consequences are real: hours-long deployment windows when every index on every table gets rebuilt, unexpected performance degradation when indexes are dropped that hadn't been captured in the repository yet, or accidental data loss when tables are dropped that still had dependencies.

One company worked on index drift alignment for over two years only to find that nothing was really better in production because new drift kept happening. The tools that stopped the drift were deployed in controlled stages with careful planning and testing -- and only after the repository was complete did they enable enforcement.

### The phased pattern

The practical approach works the same way across all alignment settings:

1. **Extract and inventory.** Use SchemaTongs to capture your current schema. Review what comes out. You may find vast differences across environments -- objects in production that don't exist in dev, duplicates, contradictions.

2. **Build up the repository in stages.** Don't try to capture everything in one shot. Add objects to your schema package in controlled stages -- maybe one schema area at a time. Deploy each stage, verify performance, confirm the deployment window is acceptable.

3. **Keep enforcement off during alignment.** While building up the repository, you don't want to accidentally drop objects you haven't captured yet. Leave enforcement settings (`DropUnknownIndexes`, `DropTablesRemovedFromProduct`) off until you're confident the repository represents the complete desired state.

4. **Turn on enforcement to prevent drift from returning.** Once the schema definition is clear and you have verified alignment across environments, enable the enforcement settings. Now SchemaSmith prevents drift from coming back the moment you turn your back.

### Settings that follow this pattern

| Setting | What it enforces | What goes wrong if you enable too early |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| `DropUnknownIndexes` | Index alignment | Indexes dropped that you haven't captured yet. Deployment may take much longer than expected, and query performance may degrade. |
| `DropTablesRemovedFromProduct` | Table cleanup | Tables dropped, data gone, rollback requires restore from backup. |
| `UpdateFillFactor` | Fill factor alignment | Every index on every table rebuilt to match declared fill factors -- potentially hours of deployment time on large databases. |

### Bite-sized is the only size

You won't get every table or scripted object into the repository in one pass. You'll find alignment problems and environmental dependencies across multiple environments that need to be resolved before those objects can be safely managed by state-based deployment. This is a long-term cure, not a miracle pill that solves everything on day one.

Add what is safe, deploy, verify, repeat. Each iteration brings more of your schema under management and stops more drift from recurring.

With more than 20 years of doing this with and without proper tooling, we have likely solved a similar problem already.
