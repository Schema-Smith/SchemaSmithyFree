# Schema Packages Reference

A schema package is your database's source of truth -- the complete, version-controlled definition of what your databases should look like. Every tool in the SchemaSmith toolset revolves around this one structure: SchemaTongs casts packages from live databases, SchemaQuench quenches them onto target servers, and DataTongs adds reference data alongside your schema. The same package format works for **SQL Server**, **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and **MariaDB** -- one shape, one workflow, four engines. Each package is bound to its declared platform, so the four package types stay distinct even where MySQL and MariaDB share an engine family.

This document is the authoritative reference for every file, folder, property, and format in a schema package.

---

## Product.json

The `Product.json` file sits at the root of the schema package and is the top-level configuration -- the starting point for every deployment. Every package must have exactly one.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | | Yes | Product name. Automatically added as a `{{ProductName}}` script token. Used for migration script tracking and version stamping. |
| `Platform` | string | | Yes | Target platform. Valid values: `"SqlServer"`, `"PostgreSQL"`, `"MySQL"`, `"MariaDb"`. Determines which platform adapter handles deployment, extraction, and the default folder set. |
| `ValidationScript` | string | | Yes | SQL expression evaluated before quench begins. Must return a truthy value or the quench aborts. Supports token replacement. |
| `TemplateOrder` | string[] | `[]` | No | Ordered list of template directory names. Templates are quenched in this order. |
| `ScriptTokens` | object | `{}` | No | Key-value pairs for `{{TokenName}}` replacement in scripts and SQL properties. See the [Script Tokens Reference](script-tokens.md). |
| `BaselineValidationScript` | string | | No | SQL expression evaluated after server validation but before template processing. |
| `VersionStampScript` | string | | No | SQL executed once after all templates complete successfully. Typically records the release version on the server. |
| `DropUnknownIndexes` | bool | `false` | No | When `true`, the table quench drops indexes on managed tables that aren't defined in the table JSON. |
| `MinimumVersion` | string | | No | Minimum target server version floor. Optional; omit to deploy against any version. If any resolved target is below the floor, SchemaQuench aborts before touching anything. See [Settings intent](#settings-intent) below. |
| `CheckConstraintStyle` | string | `"ColumnLevel"` | No | Controls how SchemaTongs writes check constraints during extraction: `"ColumnLevel"` (inline `CheckExpression` on the column) or `"TableLevel"` (named constraints in the `CheckConstraints` array). SQL Server and PostgreSQL only -- MySQL and MariaDB always extract table-level (see [Check Constraints](#check-constraints)). |
| `ScriptFolders` | array | `[]` | No | Optional product-level folder definitions. Used to add custom folder paths or assign secondary-server filtering. See [Custom Script Folders](#custom-script-folders). |
| `BranchNameFile` | string | `"{{repo_path}}/.git/HEAD"` | No | Path to the file SchemaSmith reads to derive the `{{BranchName}}` automatic token. Default points at Git's `HEAD`. Use any VCS that exposes the current branch as a single-line file (Mercurial's `.hg/branch`, Subversion working-copy markers, etc.); the only requirement is that the file exists and contains the branch identifier somewhere on its first line. |
| `BeforeBranchNameMask` | string | `"ref: refs/heads/"` | No | Prefix to strip from the line read out of `BranchNameFile`. Default matches Git's `ref: refs/heads/<branch>` format. Set to `""` for VCSs whose branch file already contains the bare branch name. |
| `AfterBranchNameMask` | string | `""` | No | Suffix to strip after the prefix is removed. Default empty. Set when your VCS appends extra text after the branch name. |
| `Extensions` | any | `null` | No | Reserved. `Product.json` does not currently use `Extensions` for custom properties. |

### Settings intent

**Platform** -- The single most important property. Once set, every tool that touches the package routes through the platform's adapter: SchemaTongs uses the right system catalog queries, SchemaQuench uses the right DDL flavors, DataTongs uses the right merge syntax. The platform value is also what triggers the correct default folder set when a template doesn't override `ScriptFolders`.

**ValidationScript** -- Answers "am I deploying to the correct server?" This is a safety gate that prevents deploying to the wrong target, not a package validation check. Common patterns: verifying a database exists, checking for expected infrastructure, confirming the server version.

**BaselineValidationScript** -- Answers "is this environment at the expected state for this deployment?" Prevents accidental rollback -- if production is at v2.5 and someone runs the v2.3 package, the baseline check aborts before touching anything. Pair with `VersionStampScript`: the stamp records the version after deployment, the baseline checks for it before the next one.

**VersionStampScript** -- Executes after deployment completes. Script tokens are resolved first, so you can pass in values like `{{ReleaseVersion}}`. Single batch only -- no `GO` separators (SQL Server), no compound DO blocks (PostgreSQL) -- but a single statement, procedure call, or `CALL` is fine. Product-level runs once on the server connection; template-level runs per database.

**DropUnknownIndexes** -- Enforces index alignment, but only when you're ready. Default `false` for good reason: most teams adopting SchemaSmith inherit environments with years of index drift. Turn this on after capturing every needed index in your repository. See [the adoption approach](../guide/11-edge-cases.md#the-adoption-approach) in the guide for the phased rollout pattern.

**MinimumVersion** -- Declares the engine-version floor the product requires. Declare it when the product depends on DDL or behavior that a known-old engine version lacks, or when you want a clean abort rather than a partial deployment against an unsupported server. SchemaQuench detects the version of every resolved target before any deployment work begins. If any target is below the declared floor, the entire run aborts -- no partial deploy, no side effects -- and the diagnostic names each below-floor target with its detected version. SQL Server accepts a major version number (`16`) or a release year (`2022`, `2019`, `2017`, `2016`); PostgreSQL accepts a major number (`15`, `16`, `17`); MySQL accepts `major.minor` (`8.0`, `8.4`); MariaDB accepts `major.minor` (`10.6`, `11.4`). An unparseable value is a configuration error that aborts at startup. If the target version cannot be determined, that is also a hard error -- SchemaSmith never deploys blind. See [SchemaQuench -- Engine Version Compatibility](schemaquench.md#engine-version-compatibility) for the full pre-flight behavior and supported engine floors.

### Example (SQL Server, Northwind demo)

```json
{
  "Name": "Northwind",
  "Platform": "SqlServer",
  "ValidationScript": "SELECT CAST(1 AS BIT)",
  "TemplateOrder": [
    "Initialize",
    "Northwind"
  ],
  "ScriptTokens": {
    "NorthwindDb": "Northwind"
  }
}
```

### Example (PostgreSQL)

```json
{
  "Name": "Northwind",
  "Platform": "PostgreSQL",
  "ValidationScript": "SELECT 1",
  "TemplateOrder": ["Northwind"],
  "ScriptTokens": {
    "NorthwindDb": "northwind"
  }
}
```

### Example (MySQL)

```json
{
  "Name": "Northwind",
  "Platform": "MySQL",
  "ValidationScript": "SELECT 1",
  "TemplateOrder": ["Northwind"],
  "ScriptTokens": {
    "NorthwindDb": "northwind"
  }
}
```

### Notes

- `ProductName` is added automatically to `ScriptTokens` -- you don't need to define it.
- Script token values defined in `Product.json` can be overridden at runtime via the tool's settings file or environment variables in the `ScriptTokens` section.
- All script properties (`ValidationScript`, `BaselineValidationScript`, `VersionStampScript`) support `{{TokenName}}` replacement and the [advanced token tags](script-tokens.md#advanced-token-tags).

---

## Template.json

Each template directory under `Templates/` must contain a `Template.json` file. A template targets one or more databases identified by its `DatabaseIdentificationScript`.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | | Yes | Template name. Must match the containing directory name. Automatically added as a `{{TemplateName}}` script token. |
| `DatabaseIdentificationScript` | string | | Yes | SQL query that returns one or more database names. SchemaQuench reads the first column of each row. Supports token replacement. |
| `IdentificationDatabase` | string | | No | Re-targets which database the `DatabaseIdentificationScript` runs against. Empty (the default) uses the platform init database. Point it at a control-plane registry database to enumerate a roster from a registry table. Token-resolvable. See [Template settings intent](#template-settings-intent). |
| `VersionStampScript` | string | | No | SQL executed per database after that database's quench completes successfully. |
| `UpdateFillFactor` | bool | `true` | No | When `true`, the table quench updates index fill factors to match the JSON definitions. OR'd with table-level and index-level `UpdateFillFactor` settings. |
| `IndexOnlyTableQuenches` | bool | `false` | No | When `true`, the table quench only manages indexes, statistics, XML/full-text indexes. Skips table creation, column changes, and foreign key management. Tables that don't exist are silently skipped. |
| `BaselineValidationScript` | string | | No | SQL validation executed per database before quenching that database. |
| `RequireAtLeastOneTarget` | bool | `true` | No | When `true`, deployment fails if discovery returns no targets -- zero matching databases for a regular template, or zero matching `(database, schema)` pairs for a schema template. Catches misconfigured identification scripts that silently skip an entire template. Replaces the prior `Required` field (renamed in v2.1). |
| `SkipIfReadOnly` | bool | `false` | No | When `true`, a read-only database is skipped -- with a log line naming the target and template -- instead of failing the quench. Enables Availability Group secondary handling on SQL Server and replica handling on other platforms. |
| `ScriptFolders` | array | `[]` | No | Optional list of `TemplateFolder` definitions. When empty, the platform's default folder set is used. When non-empty, this array fully replaces the defaults -- so include every folder you want active. See [Custom Script Folders](#custom-script-folders). |
| `ScriptTokens` | object | `{}` | No | Key-value pairs that override matching product-level tokens for this template. Template tokens take precedence over product tokens with the same key. |
| `SchemaIdentificationScript` | string | | No | **SQL Server / PostgreSQL:** query returning one column, N rows; each row is a schema name to iterate over — presence activates schema-template mode (see [Schema Templates](#schema-templates)). **MySQL:** has no in-database schema axis (a schema *is* a database), so schema templates don't apply; the field is instead accepted as a **deprecated backward-compat alias** for `DatabaseIdentificationScript` — on load its value migrates into `DatabaseIdentificationScript` (only when that is empty) and a deprecation warning advises renaming. Use `DatabaseIdentificationScript` directly on MySQL. |
| `CreateSchemaIfMissing` | bool | `false` | No | Schema templates only. When `true`, the engine creates any discovered schema that doesn't yet exist before running that iteration. See [Schema Templates](#schema-templates). |
| `AllowParallel` | bool | `true` | No | Schema templates only. When `false`, iterations of this template run serially even when the global thread pool has capacity. See [Schema Templates](#schema-templates). |
| `ContinueOnSchemaFailure` | bool | `true` | No | Schema templates only. When `false`, the first failing iteration aborts all subsequent iterations for this template. See [Schema Templates](#schema-templates). |
| `ContinueOnDatabaseFailure` | bool | `true` | No | Regular templates only. When `false`, the first failing database iteration aborts all subsequent database iterations for this template. Ignored on schema templates -- failure isolation there is governed by `ContinueOnSchemaFailure`. See [Schema Templates](#schema-templates) for the schema-iteration analog and [SchemaQuench &mdash; ContinueOnDatabaseFailure](schemaquench.md#continueondatabasefailure) for the runtime behavior detail. |

### Template settings intent

**UpdateFillFactor** -- Three levels (template, table, index) are OR'd together: if any level is true for a given index, its fill factor gets updated. Template defaults to `true` (enforce from the start for new products). For teams managing existing drift, set template-level to `false` and enable per-index or per-table as you verify alignment.

**RequireAtLeastOneTarget** -- A safety net for misconfigured `DatabaseIdentificationScript` (and `SchemaIdentificationScript`) queries. When discovery returns zero targets and `RequireAtLeastOneTarget` is `true` (the default), SchemaQuench aborts immediately rather than silently deploying nothing. Set to `false` only for templates that legitimately target zero databases (or zero `(database, schema)` pairs) in some environments.

**IdentificationDatabase** -- By default a template's `DatabaseIdentificationScript` runs against the platform init database (`master` / `postgres` / `information_schema`), which is right for catalog-convention discovery like `SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datname LIKE 'tenant_%'`. But when your fleet roster lives in a **control-plane registry table** -- `FleetRegistry.dbo.Tenants` -- the discovery query has to run against that registry database, not the init database. Set `IdentificationDatabase` to the registry database and author the script against it:

```json
{
  "Name": "TenantBody",
  "DatabaseIdentificationScript": "SELECT db_name FROM dbo.Tenants WHERE active = 1",
  "IdentificationDatabase": "FleetRegistry"
}
```

The value is token-resolvable (`"IdentificationDatabase": "{{ControlDb}}"`), so a dev fleet can resolve it to `FleetRegistry_Dev` and production to `FleetRegistry_Prod` from the same package. The re-target is scoped to the enumeration query alone: database provisioning and existence checks still run against the init database, and `SchemaIdentificationScript` (schema discovery) is unaffected.

> **PostgreSQL:** this is the only way to read a registry table at enumeration time. A PostgreSQL connection is bound to a single database and cannot cross-database-query, so without `IdentificationDatabase` a registry-table roster is unreachable -- the init database (`postgres`) has no access to a table in another database.

**SkipIfReadOnly** -- Enables graceful handling of read-only replicas. On SQL Server, this is the Availability Group secondary handling. On PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB, the same flag covers logical/physical replicas exposed as databases. With `SkipIfReadOnly: true`, a read-only database is skipped -- logged, not silent, so an operator can see which targets were passed over -- and the deployment continues with the writable primaries. Read-only is detected per engine: `DATABASEPROPERTYEX(..., 'Updateability')` on SQL Server (which covers both an Availability Group readable secondary and a database explicitly `SET READ_ONLY`), `pg_is_in_recovery()` / `transaction_read_only` on PostgreSQL, and `@@read_only` on MySQL and MariaDB (MySQL additionally checks `@@super_read_only`). Independent of `RequireAtLeastOneTarget` -- the read-only target still counts as a discovered target, so a template can require at least one target while still skipping individual read-only databases within the result set.

**IndexOnlyTableQuenches** -- Lets you manage indexes on tables you don't own. Two primary use cases: different indexing on replicated databases (tuned for the consumer's workload, not the producer's), and adding indexes to third-party products where you can't modify the table structure. Scripted objects (procedures, views, functions) still deploy when this flag is on -- so you can deploy custom views and procedures alongside supplementary indexes.

### Example (PostgreSQL)

```json
{
  "Name": "Northwind",
  "DatabaseIdentificationScript": "SELECT datname FROM pg_database WHERE datname = '{{NorthwindDb}}'",
  "UpdateFillFactor": true,
  "ScriptTokens": {}
}
```

---

## Custom Script Folders

By default, every template uses the platform's standard folder layout (see [Default Folders](#default-folders) below). When you need to **add a folder** that isn't in the defaults, **rename a folder**, or **change which slot a folder runs in**, you declare your own `ScriptFolders` array on `Template.json`.

The array is an explicit replacement, not a merge. The moment you provide `ScriptFolders` with at least one entry, the defaults are skipped entirely -- so you should include every folder you want loaded.

### TemplateFolder properties

| Property | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FolderPath` | string | Yes | Relative path under the template directory. Forward or back slashes both work. |
| `QuenchSlot` | string | Yes | Which execution slot the folder runs in. See [Quench Slot Reference](#quench-slot-reference) below for valid values. |
| `ObjectType` | string | No | When the folder contains programmable objects (functions, views, procedures, triggers, etc.), tag it with the corresponding object type so SchemaQuench can route it through the dependency-retry loop correctly. |
| `ShouldApplyExpression` | string | No | Optional SQL predicate evaluated against the target at deploy time (tokens resolved first): true deploys the folder, false skips it (logged), blank always deploys. See [Conditional Deployment](schemaquench.md#shouldapplyexpression-and-conditional-deployment). |

### Example -- adding a custom folder for an extra migration step

```json
{
  "Name": "Reporting",
  "DatabaseIdentificationScript": "SELECT [Name] FROM master.sys.databases WHERE [Name] = '{{ReportDB}}'",
  "ScriptFolders": [
    { "FolderPath": "Before Scripts", "QuenchSlot": "Before" },
    { "FolderPath": "Schemas", "QuenchSlot": "Objects", "ObjectType": "Schemas" },
    { "FolderPath": "Functions", "QuenchSlot": "Objects", "ObjectType": "Functions" },
    { "FolderPath": "Views", "QuenchSlot": "Objects", "ObjectType": "Views" },
    { "FolderPath": "Procedures", "QuenchSlot": "Objects", "ObjectType": "Procedures" },
    { "FolderPath": "BetweenTablesAndKeys", "QuenchSlot": "BetweenTablesAndKeys" },
    { "FolderPath": "AfterTables", "QuenchSlot": "AfterTablesScripts" },
    { "FolderPath": "Triggers", "QuenchSlot": "AfterTablesObjects", "ObjectType": "Triggers" },
    { "FolderPath": "Table Data", "QuenchSlot": "TableData" },
    { "FolderPath": "After Scripts", "QuenchSlot": "After" }
  ]
}
```

In this example, the team kept the standard folders but added two extra slots (`BetweenTablesAndKeys`, `AfterTablesScripts`) that aren't part of the default set. They can write migration scripts that run after the table structure exists but before foreign keys, or after the table structure but before triggers, without writing any extra glue.

### Why this matters

Custom script folders are how you make the schema package fit *your* deployment lifecycle, not the other way around. Need a folder called `Permissions` that runs in the `After` slot? Done. Need to split your large `Procedures` directory into `Procedures/Public` and `Procedures/Internal` for code review? Done. Need an entirely new slot for your team's idempotent post-deploy data fixes? Drop a folder, point it at `After`, and you're done.

### Custom product-level folders

`Product.json` can also declare custom folders via its `ScriptFolders` array (the property name is the same as `Template.json`'s). The shape is similar but uses `ProductQuenchSlot` (`Before` or `After`) and supports a `ServerToQuench` setting that controls whether the folder runs on the primary, secondaries, or both. See [Secondary Servers](#secondary-servers) below. Product folders also accept a `ShouldApplyExpression`, evaluated per server against the admin connection -- see [Conditional Deployment](schemaquench.md#shouldapplyexpression-and-conditional-deployment).

---


## PostgreSQL Extensions

SchemaSmith has no `Extensions` property, and does not need one. An extension is database-scoped and is not part of any table, so it is deployed the same way schemas and collations are — as a **scripted object**, in a folder you declare.

Add the folder to the template and put one file per extension in it:

```json
{
  "Name": "Main",
  "ScriptFolders": [
    { "FolderPath": "Extensions", "QuenchSlot": "Objects" }
  ]
}
```

```sql
-- Templates/Main/Extensions/vector.sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

`QuenchSlot: Objects` runs the folder **before** the tables, which is what you want when a column's type comes from the extension — `vector`, `citext`, `hstore`, `postgis` all need the extension in place before the table that uses them is created.

> **Warning:** Object scripts run on **every** quench, so the script must be idempotent. `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS` is; a bare `CREATE EXTENSION` fails on the second deploy.

### What SchemaSmith will and will not do

- **Create it** when the script says so, on every target the template reaches.
- **Never remove it.** Scripted objects are not dropped by absence — that applies only to tables, their components, and materialized views. Deleting the file stops SchemaSmith creating the extension; it does not uninstall one that is already there. That is deliberate: `DROP EXTENSION` cascades into every column, index, and constraint that depends on its types, which is not something a package edit should be able to do.
- **Never upgrade it.** Pin a version with `CREATE EXTENSION … VERSION '1.2'` if you need one. `ALTER EXTENSION … UPDATE` runs migration scripts written by the extension's author, so it belongs in a migration script you control, not in a schema deploy.

### Privileges

`CREATE EXTENSION` usually needs superuser; PostgreSQL 13+ relaxes that to the database owner for *trusted* extensions. If the deploy user has neither, the script fails with PostgreSQL's own permission error — install the extension once as an administrator and the idempotent script becomes a no-op from then on.

## Default Folders

When `Template.json` does not declare its own `ScriptFolders`, SchemaSmith fills in a platform-specific default set. Each platform's defaults reflect the object types and lifecycle stages that platform actually supports.

### SQL Server default folders

| Folder | Quench Slot | Object Type |
|---|---|---|
| `Before Scripts/` | Before | — |
| `Schemas/` | Objects | Schemas |
| `DataTypes/` | Objects | DataTypes |
| `FullTextCatalogs/` | Objects | FullTextCatalogs |
| `FullTextStopLists/` | Objects | FullTextStopLists |
| `XMLSchemaCollections/` | Objects | XMLSchemaCollections |
| `Functions/` | Objects | Functions |
| `Views/` | Objects | Views |
| `Procedures/` | Objects | Procedures |
| `Sequences/` | Objects | Sequences |
| `Synonyms/` | Objects | Synonyms |
| `Triggers/` | AfterTablesObjects | Triggers |
| `DDLTriggers/` | AfterTablesObjects | DDLTriggers |
| `SchemaBound Views/` | AfterTablesObjects | SchemaBoundViews |
| `SchemaBound Functions/` | AfterTablesObjects | SchemaBoundFunctions |
| `Table Data/` | TableData | — |
| `After Scripts/` | After | — |

> **Legacy fallback (SQL Server only):** If your existing package has `MigrationScripts/Before/`, `MigrationScripts/After/`, or a `TableData/` folder (no space) on disk, SchemaSmith will use them in place of `Before Scripts/`, `After Scripts/`, and `Table Data/` respectively. This keeps older packages working without a folder rename.

### PostgreSQL default folders

| Folder | Quench Slot | Object Type |
|---|---|---|
| `Before Scripts/` | Before | — |
| `Schemas/` | Objects | Schemas |
| `Domain Types/` | Objects | DomainTypes |
| `Enum Types/` | Objects | EnumTypes |
| `Composite Types/` | Objects | CompositeTypes |
| `Collations/` | Objects | Collations |
| `Functions/` | Objects | Functions |
| `Trigger Functions/` | Objects | TriggerFunctions |
| `Window Functions/` | Objects | WindowFunctions |
| `Aggregates/` | Objects | Aggregates |
| `Procedures/` | Objects | Procedures |
| `Sequences/` | Objects | Sequences |
| `Publications/` | Objects | Publications |
| `Rules/` | AfterTablesObjects | Rules |
| `Triggers/` | AfterTablesObjects | Triggers |
| `Views/` | AfterTablesObjects | Views |
| `Table Data/` | TableData | — |
| `After Scripts/` | After | — |

### MySQL default folders

| Folder | Quench Slot | Object Type |
|---|---|---|
| `Before Scripts/` | Before | — |
| `Events/` | Objects | Events |
| `Functions/` | Objects | Functions |
| `Procedures/` | Objects | Procedures |
| `Triggers/` | AfterTablesObjects | Triggers |
| `Views/` | AfterTablesObjects | Views |
| `Table Data/` | TableData | — |
| `After Scripts/` | After | — |

### MariaDB default folders

| Folder | Quench Slot | Object Type |
|---|---|---|
| `Before Scripts/` | Before | — |
| `Events/` | Objects | Events |
| `Functions/` | Objects | Functions |
| `Procedures/` | Objects | Procedures |
| `Sequences/` | Objects | Sequences |
| `Triggers/` | AfterTablesObjects | Triggers |
| `Views/` | AfterTablesObjects | Views |
| `Table Data/` | TableData | — |
| `After Scripts/` | After | — |

MariaDB has a native `SEQUENCE` object and so gets a `Sequences/` folder; MySQL has no equivalent at any version, which is why its default set has none -- a `Sequences/` folder in a MySQL package is simply not read.

Tables are always loaded from `Tables/` regardless of platform. SQL Server adds `Indexed Views/`; PostgreSQL adds `Materialized Views/`. These are not script folders -- they hold structured JSON object definitions, not `.sql` files.

---

## Quench Slot Reference

`TemplateQuenchSlot` controls when in the deployment lifecycle a folder's scripts run.

| Slot | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `Before` | One-time migration scripts that run after initial object creation and new table creation, but before table modifications. Use for data preparation that must happen before columns are altered or dropped. Sequential, tracked. |
| `Objects` | Database objects that may have cross-dependencies (schemas, types, catalogs, functions, views, procedures). The retry loop resolves creation order automatically. |
| `BetweenTablesAndKeys` | Migration scripts that need the table structure to exist but must run before foreign key constraints are enforced. Typical use: populating a new NOT NULL column before FKs block the data load. Sequential, tracked. |
| `AfterTablesScripts` | Migration scripts that depend on the final table and key structure but must run before triggers are deployed. Sequential, tracked. |
| `AfterTablesObjects` | Triggers, DDL triggers, rules, and views that depend on the completed table structure. Dependency retry loop. |
| `TableData` | Data population scripts (MERGE statements, INSERT/UPDATE seeds). Run after triggers are deployed but before foreign key constraints are applied. Dependency retry loop. |
| `After` | Final migration scripts. Run after all database objects and data are deployed. Sequential, tracked. |

`ProductQuenchSlot` has only two values:

| Slot | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `Before` | Product-level scripts that run before any template processing begins. Sequential, untracked (run every deployment). |
| `After` | Product-level scripts that run after all templates complete. Sequential, untracked. |

### Execution behaviors

**Sequential, untracked** -- Product-level scripts run in alphabetical order on every deployment. They aren't recorded in any tracking table. Write these scripts to be idempotent.

**Sequential, tracked** -- Template-level migration scripts run in alphabetical order. Each script's completion is recorded in the `CompletedMigrationScripts` table and won't run again on subsequent quenches. Scripts with `[ALWAYS]` in the filename run every time regardless of tracking.

**Dependency retry loop** -- All scripts in the slot are attempted. Scripts that fail due to unresolved dependencies are retried on the next iteration. The loop continues until all scripts succeed or no progress is made on an iteration.

---

## Secondary Servers

For **SQL Server** deployments targeting Availability Groups, SchemaQuench can quench to a primary plus one or more secondary servers in parallel, automatically routing each script folder to the right server based on its `ServerToQuench` setting.

Configure secondaries in `SchemaQuench.settings.json`:

```json
{
  "Target": {
    "Server": "primary-replica",
    "SecondaryServers": "secondary-1,secondary-2"
  }
}
```

Then declare `ServerToQuench` on your product-level folders:

```json
{
  "Name": "MyProduct",
  "Platform": "SqlServer",
  "ScriptFolders": [
    { "FolderPath": "Before Product",        "QuenchSlot": "Before", "ServerToQuench": "Both" },
    { "FolderPath": "Linked Server Setup",   "QuenchSlot": "Before", "ServerToQuench": "Primary" },
    { "FolderPath": "Local Cache Build",     "QuenchSlot": "After",  "ServerToQuench": "Secondary" }
  ]
}
```

`ServerToQuench` accepts `Primary`, `Secondary`, or `Both`. The default is `Primary`. Scripts in folders with `Both` (or scripts marked for the active server type) execute on every server in the list, in parallel. The CLI logs the per-server progress so you can see exactly what landed where.

> **Multi-platform note:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB deployments use a single connection only -- the secondary-server feature is SQL Server-specific because Availability Groups are a SQL Server concept.

---

## Complete Folder Structure

A schema package is a predictable directory tree. Every tool in the SchemaSmith toolset discovers what it needs by convention -- `Product.json` at the root, `Templates/` one level down, platform-specific script folders inside each template -- so you never have to configure paths or point a tool at individual files. Marker files and generated artifacts sit alongside the files you author, and the whole layout maps cleanly onto source control.

```
MyProduct/
  Product.json                      Product configuration (required)
  .json-schemas/                    JSON Schema files for IDE validation (generated)
    products.<platform>.schema      <platform> = sqlserver, postgresql, mysql, or mariadb
    templates.<platform>.schema
    tables.<platform>.schema

      <custom folders>              Anything you declared in ScriptFolders
```

Table JSON files are named `schema.tablename.json` (e.g., `dbo.Customer.json`, `public.order_lines.json`). The `schema` segment mirrors the table's own `Schema` property, so it is omitted whenever the table carries no schema -- on MySQL and MariaDB (no per-table schema), and in schema templates, where the schema is the iteration variable. See [File naming](#file-naming) below. If a table or schema name contains filesystem-illegal characters, the encoded form is used in the filename (see [Filesystem-Illegal Character Encoding](#filesystem-illegal-character-encoding)).

### File naming

How you name table JSON files depends on whether the template is a regular template or a schema template.

**Regular templates** use schema-prefixed filenames: `dbo.Customers.json`, `Sales.Orders.json`, `public.order_lines.json`. The prefix *mirrors* the table's `Schema` property -- it is a convention, not an input. A table's schema is read from its file content, never from its filename, so a file you renamed by hand still deploys to the same place; [`--Validate`](validate.md#file-naming) flags the drift as an `SS-FILE-NAME-003` warning rather than an error.

Omitting `Schema` is not an error either -- it falls back to the platform default (`dbo` on SQL Server, `public` on PostgreSQL, none on MySQL and MariaDB). Because the filename mirrors content, a table that omits `Schema` has no prefix to mirror, and its canonical name is the bare `order_lines.json`. Both forms are correct so long as the filename and the content agree: declare `Schema: "public"` and name the file `public.order_lines.json` (what the shipped PostgreSQL demos do), or omit both. On extraction SchemaTongs writes the omitted form for a table in the platform default schema, and keeps the prefix for a named one.

**Schema templates** use unqualified filenames. The schema is the iteration variable -- SchemaQuench resolves `{{SchemaName}}` at runtime for every iteration, so `Customers.json` deploys into `acme.Customers` for the `acme` tenant, `globex.Customers` for the `globex` tenant, and so on. Filenames with a schema prefix (e.g., `dbo.Customers.json`) inside a schema template's `Tables/` folder are rejected by the engine at load time.

**Cross-schema tables.** A schema template cannot own a table in a specific named schema. Both routes to it are rejected at load time: a schema-prefixed filename in its `Tables/` folder (above), and a literal `Schema` value on the table itself -- a schema template requires `Schema` to be omitted, empty, or the literal `{{SchemaName}}` token, because the table lives in `{{SchemaName}}` by construction. Put shared, fixed-schema tables such as `dbo.SharedConfig` in the accompanying regular template that runs first in `TemplateOrder`.

The accompanying **Shared** regular template (if present) follows the regular-template convention above: `dbo.Tenants.json` on SQL Server, `countries.json` for a PostgreSQL `public` table, `reference.countries.json` for one in a named schema. Its filenames are unchanged by the presence of a schema template in the same product.

For a worked layout showing these conventions side by side, see [Multi-Tenant Deployments](../guide/10-multi-tenant-deployments.md).

SQL script files can be organized into subdirectories within any script folder. All `.sql` files are discovered recursively and sorted alphabetically by full path.

## Table JSON Format -- Shared Properties

Every table definition file declares exactly one table. The shared properties below appear on every platform; platform-specific extensions follow in the next section.

| Property | Type | Default | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | | Yes | Table name. Use the platform's quote style: `[Customer]` (SQL Server), `"customer"` (PostgreSQL), `` `customer` `` (MySQL). Bare names are also accepted. |
| `Columns` | array | `[]` | Yes | Column definitions. See [Columns](#columns). |
| `Indexes` | array | `[]` | No | Index and constraint definitions. See [Indexes](#indexes). |
| `ForeignKeys` | array | `[]` | No | Foreign key definitions. See [Foreign Keys](#foreign-keys). |
| `CheckConstraints` | array | `[]` | No | Table-level check constraint definitions. See [Check Constraints](#check-constraints). |
| `ShouldApplyExpression` | string | | No | SQL expression evaluated at quench time. If it returns false (or `0`), the entire table is skipped on this database. Tokens are resolved before evaluation. See [Conditional Application](#conditional-application). |
| `VariantName` | string | | No | Optional label for a conditional variant. Appears in deployment log messages when the variant applies, and documents the intent behind the `ShouldApplyExpression`. Max 128 characters. |
| `OldName` | string | `""` | No | Previous table name. When set, the table is renamed during quench. Clear after the rename has been deployed everywhere. |
| `DataDelivery` | object | `null` | No | Declarative data delivery configuration for this table. See [DataDelivery](#datadelivery). |
| `Extensions` | object | `null` | No | Open metadata bag. See [Custom Properties](custom-properties.md). |

The `ShouldApplyExpression` field appears on **tables, columns, indexes, foreign keys, check constraints, indexed views, materialized views, data deliveries**, and several platform-specific components. Wherever it appears, it works the same way: the engine resolves tokens, runs the expression against the target database, and skips the component if the result is falsy.

---

## Platform-Specific Table Properties

Each platform's table definition extends the shared properties with engine-specific fields.

### SQL Server (`SqlServerTable`)

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Schema` | string | `"dbo"` | Database schema. Use bracket notation in extracted files (e.g., `"[Production]"`). |
| `CompressionType` | string | `"NONE"` | Data compression: `"NONE"`, `"ROW"`, `"PAGE"`. |
| `XmlCompression` | bool | `false` | **SQL Server 2022+.** Compresses XML column data in place. Independent of `CompressionType` — a table can carry both. **Deployable from 2022 but only readable from 2025:** `sys.partitions.xml_compression` does not exist before then, so on 2022–2024 SchemaSmith applies the setting and cannot read it back. SchemaTongs carries the declared value forward from the package it is refreshing rather than dropping it, and drift is not re-evaluated there — the setting is applied at create. On 2025+ it round-trips and converges normally. Below 2022 the clause is suppressed and reported through `UnsupportedFeaturePolicy`. |
| `IsTemporal` | bool | `false` | When `true`, SchemaQuench manages the table as system-versioned temporal: emits `ALTER TABLE ... SET (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = ON (HISTORY_TABLE = <Schema>.<Name>_Hist))` and protects the period columns (`ValidFrom` / `ValidTo`) from drop detection. When toggled back to `false`, SchemaQuench emits `SET (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = OFF)`. The history table itself (`<Name>_Hist` in the same schema) is not auto-created -- declare it as a sibling table JSON in your package or rely on a Before script that creates it before the `IsTemporal=true` table is quenched. |
| `XmlIndexes` | array | `[]` | XML index definitions. See [XML Indexes (SQL Server)](#xml-indexes-sql-server). |
| `Statistics` | array | `[]` | Custom statistics definitions. See [Statistics (SQL Server)](#statistics-sql-server). |
| `FullTextIndex` | object or array | `null` | Full-text index on the table -- a single definition, or an array of conditional variants. See [Full-Text Index (SQL Server)](#full-text-index-sql-server). |
| `UpdateFillFactor` | bool | `false` | When `true`, index fill factors on this table are updated to match JSON definitions during quench. |
| `EnableCDC` | bool | `false` | When `true`, the table is enabled for change data capture. Changing a tracked table's columns rotates to a new capture instance rather than discarding history -- see [Change Data Capture (SQL Server)](#change-data-capture-sql-server). |
| `EnableChangeTracking` | bool | `false` | When `true`, the table is enabled for SQL Server change tracking. Requires Change Tracking enabled on the database -- see [Change Tracking (SQL Server)](#change-tracking-sql-server). Unrelated to the full-text index option also spelled `ChangeTracking`. |
| `TrackColumnsUpdated` | bool | `false` | Only meaningful with `EnableChangeTracking`. When `true`, change tracking records **which columns** changed, not merely that the row did, at the cost of extra tracking storage. |
| `FileGroup` | string | `null` | Filegroup the table is stored on, as a **name only** -- never a file path, so the package stays portable across environments. **Leave it unset and SchemaSmith does not manage placement at all** — the table is created wherever SQL Server would put it, and an existing table is left exactly where it is, including on a filegroup someone placed it on by hand. SchemaSmith does not create filegroups: if the named one does not exist on the target the deploy fails. Moving an existing table to a different filegroup is a rebuild, so a declared name that differs from where the table already lives also fails -- migrate it manually. Removing the property again does not move anything back; it just stops SchemaSmith checking placement. Create filegroups in a migration script, supplying environment-specific paths through [script tokens](script-tokens.md). |
| `FileStreamFileGroup` | string | `null` | The table's `FILESTREAM_ON` filegroup, as a **name only**. `null` means the database's default FILESTREAM filegroup. Effectively immutable -- SQL Server refuses to reassign a table that already has one, so a declared name differing from the deployed one fails rather than being ignored. See [FILESTREAM (SQL Server)](#filestream-sql-server). |
| `TextImageFileGroup` | string | `null` | The table's `TEXTIMAGE_ON` filegroup -- where large-object data lands -- as a **name only**. `null` means the default. Large-object columns are `text`, `ntext`, `image`, `xml`, and the `(MAX)` types; **a FILESTREAM column does not count**. Declaring it on a table with no large-object column is refused by name, because SQL Server rejects `TEXTIMAGE_ON` outright there (error 1709). Create-time only, like the other two placement clauses: a declared name that differs from the deployed one fails rather than being ignored. |
| `PartitionScheme` | string | `null` | Partition scheme the table is stored on, as a **name only** — SchemaSmith never creates a partition function or scheme, exactly as it never creates a filegroup. Declared together with `PartitionColumn`; one without the other is refused, because `ON <scheme>` needs the column the function is applied to. Cannot be combined with `FileGroup`: a table lives on one data space. A declared scheme that does not exist on the target fails by name before any DDL runs. **Applied when the table is created; a change on a deployed table is refused** — moving a table onto, off, or between schemes rewrites every row, and comparing two layouts cannot tell you whether a `SPLIT` or a `MERGE` was intended. Leave it unset and SchemaSmith does not manage partitioning at all, so a table someone partitioned by hand is left exactly as it is. |
| `PartitionColumn` | string | `null` | The column the partition function is applied to. One column — SQL Server partitions on a single column. Declared with `PartitionScheme` or not at all. |
| `GraphType` | string | `null` | `"Node"` or `"Edge"` creates the table `AS NODE` / `AS EDGE`. `null` or `"None"` is an ordinary table. **Create-time only** -- SQL Server has no `ALTER` that converts a table to or from a graph table, so changing this on a deployed table is refused rather than attempted. Requires SQL Server 2017; below that the table deploys as an ordinary one and the change is reported through `UnsupportedFeaturePolicy`. The graph pseudo-columns SQL Server adds are never extracted and never dropped. |
| `Ledger` | string | `null` | `"AppendOnly"` or `"Updatable"` creates a tamper-evident ledger table. `null` or `"Off"` is an ordinary table. Cannot be combined with `IsTemporal` -- a ledger table manages its own history, and SQL Server reports it as non-temporal. Requires SQL Server 2022; below that the table deploys as an ordinary one and the change is reported through `UnsupportedFeaturePolicy`. **Close to permanent:** there is no `ALTER` to or from a ledger table, and `DROP` does not remove one -- SQL Server retains it under a generated name -- so changing this on a deployed table is refused. |
| `HistoryTableSchema` | string | `null` | Schema of the temporal history table when `IsTemporal` is `true`. `null` means the same schema as the versioned table. |
| `HistoryTableName` | string | `null` | Name of the temporal history table when `IsTemporal` is `true`. `null` means `<Name>_Hist`. Pointing an existing temporal table at a *different* history table is not something SchemaQuench performs. |
| `HistoryRetentionPeriod` | string | `null` | Retention for the temporal history table, as the SQL Server token (e.g. `"5 YEARS"`, `"90 DAYS"`, `"INFINITE"`). `null` leaves retention unmanaged. |
| `MemoryOptimized` | bool | `false` | Creates the table in the In-Memory OLTP engine (`MEMORY_OPTIMIZED = ON`) instead of on disk. The database must already have a `MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_DATA` filegroup and the server must support In-Memory OLTP; SchemaSmith creates neither and **fails by name rather than degrading** — see [Memory-Optimized Tables](#memory-optimized-tables-sql-server). **Create-time only:** SQL Server has no `ALTER` that moves a table into or out of the memory-optimized engine, so changing this on a deployed table is refused rather than attempted. |
| `Durability` | string | `"SCHEMA_AND_DATA"` | `"SCHEMA_AND_DATA"` keeps both the schema and the rows across a restart; `"SCHEMA_ONLY"` keeps the schema and discards every row — genuinely useful for staging and session tables, and genuine data loss if you reach for it by accident. Only meaningful with `MemoryOptimized`. Omitted or blank becomes `SCHEMA_AND_DATA`, and the value is upper-cased before use. **Create-time only** — there is no `ALTER` for a memory-optimized table's durability, so a change is refused. |

### PostgreSQL (`PostgreSqlTable`)

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Schema` | string | `"public"` | Database schema. Use double-quote notation in extracted files (e.g., `"\"sales\""`). |
| `Statistics` | array | `[]` | Extended statistics definitions. |
| `ExcludeConstraints` | array | `[]` | Exclusion constraint definitions. See [Exclude Constraints (PostgreSQL)](#exclude-constraints-postgresql). |
| `RowLevelSecurity` | bool | `false` | Enables row-level security on the table. **On its own this denies everything:** a table with row-level security enabled and no policy returns no rows to anyone but its owner, so pair it with `Policies`.
| `Policies` | array | `[]` | Row-level security policy definitions. See [Row-Level Security Policies (PostgreSQL)](#row-level-security-policies-postgresql). |
| `ForceRowLevelSecurity` | bool | `false` | When `true`, row-level security is enforced even for the table owner. |
| `AccessMethod` | string | `null` | Storage access method (e.g., `"heap"`). |
| `PersistenceType` | string | `null` | Persistence override (e.g., `"UNLOGGED"`, `"TEMPORARY"`). |
| `ReplicaIdentity` | string | `null` | `REPLICA IDENTITY` for logical replication: `"DEFAULT"`, `"FULL"`, `"NOTHING"` or `"INDEX"`. **On a table that belongs to a publication this decides whether `UPDATE` and `DELETE` are permitted at all** — PostgreSQL refuses both when there is no usable identity. Omit to leave the server's current setting alone; extraction emits it only for a table that is not at `DEFAULT`. |
| `Tablespace` | string | `null` | The tablespace the table's data lives on. Omitting it means placement is **not managed** — it does **not** declare the database default, so a table a DBA placed by hand is left alone. Create-time only: moving an existing table rewrites it under an `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock, so a declared tablespace that differs from where the table already lives is refused by name rather than performed. |
| `ReplicaIdentityIndex` | string | `null` | Names the unique index backing `ReplicaIdentity: "INDEX"`. The index must be unique, non-partial and over `NOT NULL` columns. Applied after indexes are created, so it works on a table's first deploy. |
| `UpdateFillFactor` | bool | `false` | Enables fill-factor reconciliation for this table. |
| `FillFactor` | short (0--100) | `0` | Table fill factor. `0` means use the server default. |

### MySQL (`MySqlTable`)

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Engine` | string | `"InnoDB"` | Storage engine. |
| `RowFormat` | string | `null` | Row format: `"DYNAMIC"`, `"COMPACT"`, `"COMPRESSED"`, or `"REDUNDANT"`. |
| `CharacterSet` | string | `null` | Default character set for the table. |
| `Collation` | string | `null` | Default collation for the table. |
| `Comment` | string | `null` | Table comment. |
| `AutoIncrementValue` | ulong | `null` | Initial auto-increment seed value. Applied at quench time using set-if-higher semantics: the seed is only raised, never lowered (MySQL clamps a below-current value to max+1, so skipping the statement avoids phantom DDL on every quench). |
| `FullTextIndexes` | array | `[]` | Full-text index definitions (MySQL supports multiple per table). See [Full-Text Indexes (MySQL)](#full-text-indexes-mysql). |
| `Compression` | string | `null` | **MySQL only.** InnoDB transparent page compression: `"zlib"`, `"lz4"` or `"none"`. Cannot be combined with `RowFormat: "COMPRESSED"` — MySQL refuses that with error 1031, and `--Validate` reports `SS-CO-001` first. MariaDB spells this `PageCompressed`. |
| `KeyBlockSize` | int | `null` | InnoDB compressed-page size in KB (1, 2, 4, 8, 16). Only meaningful with `RowFormat: "COMPRESSED"`. |
| `Encryption` | string | `null` | **MySQL only.** InnoDB at-rest tablespace encryption: `"Y"` or `"N"`. Unset means SchemaSmith does not manage encryption, so a tablespace someone encrypted by hand is left as it is. **Converges both ways** — unlike the placement properties below, turning encryption on or off rebuilds the tablespace in place without discarding anything, so there is no data-loss direction to refuse. There is no version gate: a server with no keyring plugin rejects the statement with its own error, which is server configuration rather than a version floor. MariaDB uses `Encrypted` instead. |
| `DataDirectory` | string | `null` | The filesystem directory the table's data file is placed in (InnoDB `DATA DIRECTORY`). MySQL additionally requires the directory to be listed in the server's `innodb_directories`. **Applied at create; a move is refused by name** — MySQL and MariaDB cannot relocate a table's data file in place, so a declared directory that differs from the deployed one stops the run rather than being silently ignored. **The refusal fires under `--WhatIf` too**, because there is no safe preview of a change that cannot be made. Unset means placement is unmanaged, not "has none". |
| `Tablespace` | string | `null` | **MySQL only.** The general tablespace the table is placed in. Same posture as `DataDirectory` — applied at create, a move refused by name, unset means unmanaged. MariaDB has no general tablespaces. |
| `Partitioning` | object | `null` | How the table is partitioned. See [Partitioning (MySQL / MariaDB)](#partitioning-mysql--mariadb). Leave it unset and SchemaSmith does not manage partitioning at all, so a table someone partitioned by hand is left exactly as it is. |

### MariaDB (`MariaDbTable`)

MariaDB tables carry every MySQL property above, plus the ones below for features MySQL has no equivalent for.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Engine` | string | `"InnoDB"` | Storage engine. |
| `RowFormat` | string | `null` | Row format: `"DYNAMIC"`, `"COMPACT"`, `"COMPRESSED"`, or `"REDUNDANT"`. |
| `CharacterSet` | string | `null` | Default character set for the table. |
| `Collation` | string | `null` | Default collation for the table. |
| `Comment` | string | `null` | Table comment. |
| `AutoIncrementValue` | ulong | `null` | Initial auto-increment seed value. Applied at quench time using set-if-higher semantics: the seed is only raised, never lowered (MariaDB clamps a below-current value to max+1, so skipping the statement avoids phantom DDL on every quench). |
| `FullTextIndexes` | array | `[]` | Full-text index definitions (MariaDB supports multiple per table). See [Full-Text Indexes (MySQL)](#full-text-indexes-mysql). |
| `IsSystemVersioned` | bool | `false` | The table keeps its own row history (`WITH SYSTEM VERSIONING`, MariaDB 10.3+). **Deployed, not just extracted:** a new table is created `WITH SYSTEM VERSIONING`, and an existing ordinary table that starts declaring it converges through `ALTER TABLE … ADD SYSTEM VERSIONING`. Detected from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES.TABLE_TYPE`, which answers for both authoring forms. **Removing it is refused by name** — MariaDB's `DROP SYSTEM VERSIONING` purges the accumulated row history rather than switching the attribute off, so SchemaSmith stops instead, and **the refusal fires under `--WhatIf` too**. Extraction only writes the property when it is true, so that refusal reaches you only after a deliberate hand-edit. Requires MariaDB 10.3; below that, and on MySQL at any version, the clause is dropped and the degrade is reported through [`Target:UnsupportedFeaturePolicy`](configuration.md). |
| `Encrypted` | bool | `false` | **MariaDB only.** InnoDB at-rest tablespace encryption (`ENCRYPTED=YES`). MySQL uses the `Encryption` string instead. **Converges both ways** — toggling it rebuilds the tablespace in place and discards nothing, so neither direction is refused. A server with no encryption plugin configured rejects the statement with its own error. |
| `EncryptionKeyId` | int | `null` | **MariaDB only.** The encryption key to use (`ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID`). Only meaningful alongside `Encrypted`. |
| `Periods` | array | `[]` | Application-time period definitions (`PERIOD FOR`). See the MariaDB period notes. |
| `DropPeriodsRemovedFromProduct` | bool | `null` | Overrides the environment-level flag for this table. Defaults **off**, unlike the other drop-by-absence flags. |
| `PageCompressed` | bool | `false` | **MariaDB only.** InnoDB page compression — MariaDB's equivalent of MySQL's `Compression`, which it does not support. Cannot be combined with `RowFormat: "COMPRESSED"` (errno 140); `--Validate` reports `SS-CO-001`. |
| `PageCompressionLevel` | int | `null` | **MariaDB only.** Compression level 1–9. Ignored unless `PageCompressed` is set, which `--Validate` reports as `SS-CO-002`. |

#### MariaDB columns (`MariaDbColumn`)

MariaDB columns carry every MySQL column property, plus:

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `WithoutSystemVersioning` | bool | `false` | Excludes this column from the row history of a system-versioned table: an `UPDATE` touching only this column writes no history row. Typically used for a large or high-churn column whose history is not worth keeping. **Meaningless unless the table is system-versioned** — MariaDB accepts the clause on an ordinary table and silently discards it, so `--Validate` reports `SS-SV-001` rather than letting it look applied. Changing it on a deployed column is an `ALTER`, so it needs `SystemVersioningAlterHistory: "KEEP"`. Requires MariaDB 10.3.4+; below that the clause is suppressed and the column deploys ordinarily. |

### Minimal example (PostgreSQL)

```json
{
  "Name": "region",
  "Schema": "public",
  "Columns": [
    { "Name": "region_id",          "DataType": "INTEGER", "Nullable": false },
    { "Name": "region_description", "DataType": "VARCHAR(50)", "Nullable": false }
  ],
  "Indexes": [
    {
      "Name": "pk_region",
      "PrimaryKey": true,
      "Unique": true,
      "IndexColumns": "region_id"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Minimal example (MySQL)

```json
{
  "Name": "region",
  "Engine": "InnoDB",
  "Columns": [
    { "Name": "region_id",          "DataType": "INT",          "Nullable": false },
    { "Name": "region_description", "DataType": "VARCHAR(50)", "Nullable": false }
  ],
  "Indexes": [
    {
      "Name": "PRIMARY",
      "PrimaryKey": true,
      "Unique": true,
      "IndexColumns": "region_id"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Columns

Every entry in the `Columns` array defines one column. The shared shape is small; platform-specific column subclasses add fields where the engine genuinely differs.

### Shared column properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | | Column name. |
| `DataType` | string | | Platform-appropriate data type with precision/scale/length. SQL Server: `NVARCHAR(50)`, `INT IDENTITY(1,1)`. PostgreSQL: `VARCHAR(50)`, `INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY`. MySQL: `VARCHAR(50)`, `INT AUTO_INCREMENT`. |
| `Nullable` | bool | `false` | Whether the column allows NULL. |
| `Default` | string | | Default constraint expression -- e.g., `"getdate()"` (SQL Server), `"now()"` (PostgreSQL), `"CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"` (MySQL). |
| `ShouldApplyExpression` | string | | Conditional inclusion. See [Conditional Application](#conditional-application). |
| `VariantName` | string | | Optional label for a conditional variant. Appears in deployment log messages when the variant applies, and documents the intent behind the `ShouldApplyExpression`. Max 128 characters. |
| `OldName` | string | `""` | Previous column name for rename detection. Clear after the rename has deployed everywhere. |
| `Extensions` | object | `null` | Custom metadata for this column. See [Custom Properties](custom-properties.md). |


### `DataType` is passed through, not validated

`DataType` is free text. SchemaSmith does not keep a list of type names — it hands what you wrote to the engine, which is what lets you use any type the engine accepts, including ones newer than your copy of SchemaSmith. `IDENTITY` and `ROWGUIDCOL` ride the same string for the same reason.

The trade is worth knowing before it surprises you:

> **Warning:** A type that the target's engine version does not have fails with the **engine's own error**, not a SchemaSmith message. Declaring `UUID` against MariaDB 10.6 gets you `Unknown data type: 'UUID'`. Version-*gated features* degrade politely through [`UnsupportedFeaturePolicy`](schemaquench.md); types do not, because SchemaSmith has no list to check them against.

Types this affects in practice: MariaDB `UUID` (10.7+), MySQL `VECTOR` (9.0+), SQL Server native `json` (2025+), and vector types generally.

**If your fleet straddles the version**, gate the declaration rather than hoping: put the newer form behind a [`ShouldApplyExpression`](#conditional-application) so only targets that can take it receive it. That is the supported answer, and it works for any type, including ones added after this page was written.

### SQL Server column extras

`CheckExpression`, `ComputedExpression`, `Persisted`, `Sparse`, `IsColumnSet`, `Collation`, `DataMaskFunction`, `FileStream` (see [FILESTREAM (SQL Server)](#filestream-sql-server)). Identity is part of the `DataType` string (`INT IDENTITY(1,1)`); `ROWGUIDCOL` likewise (`UNIQUEIDENTIFIER ROWGUIDCOL`).

`IsColumnSet: true` declares `COLUMN_SET FOR ALL_SPARSE_COLUMNS` -- an XML column that aggregates the table's sparse columns. Available at the SQL Server 2008 floor, alongside `Sparse`. Adding a column set and the sparse columns it aggregates together in one deploy always works, whether the table is new or already exists. **Known limitation:** converting an *already-deployed* plain column into a column set in the same deploy that also introduces a brand-new sparse column is not supported -- the new sparse column commits before the conversion runs, and SQL Server refuses a column set on a table that already has a sparse column. The conversion works on its own (no new sparse columns in the same deploy, and none pre-existing on the table); combined with a new sparse column, it fails with SQL Server's own error.

`BackfillExistingRows: true` populates rows that are **already in the table** when the column is added, using its
`Default`. SQL Server leaves those rows `NULL` when a *nullable* column with a default is added -- a `NOT NULL`
column is backfilled anyway -- so this is the setting that makes "new nullable column, existing rows get the
default" authorable. It requires `Default`; without one there is no value to apply and `--Validate` reports
`SS-COL-001`. It has no effect when the column is created as part of a new table, since there are no existing rows.

> **Note:** This is a SQL Server difference, not a general one. PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB backfill the default
> on `ADD COLUMN` already, so the setting exists only here.

### PostgreSQL column extras

`GenerationExpression` (for stored generated columns), `Collation`, identity columns expressed via `DataType` (`INTEGER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY` or `GENERATED ALWAYS`).

### MySQL column extras

`GenerationExpression`, `CharacterSet`, `Collation`, `Comment`, auto-increment via `DataType` (`INT AUTO_INCREMENT`).

`Invisible` (bool) hides a column from `SELECT *` and from an `INSERT` that names no column list; it is still readable when named explicitly. Requires MySQL 8.0.23 or MariaDB 10.3 -- below those the column deploys visible, per the [unsupported-feature policy](schemaquench.md#version-adaptive-code-generation).

`Srid` (int) restricts a spatial column to one spatial reference system -- `"Srid": 4326` deploys as `col POINT SRID 4326`, so the column accepts only geometries in that reference system. MySQL 8.0.3+ only; below that (and on MariaDB, which has no equivalent attribute at any version) the restriction is silently skipped and the column deploys unrestricted, per the [unsupported-feature policy](schemaquench.md#version-adaptive-code-generation). Omit `Srid` for an unrestricted spatial column.

`OnUpdateCurrentTimestamp` (string) auto-refreshes a `TIMESTAMP`/`DATETIME` column on every `UPDATE` -- `"OnUpdateCurrentTimestamp": "CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"` deploys as `... ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, and an optional fractional-seconds precision round-trips exactly (`"CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(3)"`). Independent of `Default`: a column's `Default` governs its value on `INSERT`, this governs the refresh on `UPDATE` -- declare either, both, or neither. Available on every supported MySQL and MariaDB version, so no version gate applies.

### User-defined types

When a database uses user-defined types (`CREATE TYPE` / `CREATE DOMAIN`), the `DataType` value is the type name, and the type must exist before the table quench runs. How you get it there depends on the folder:

| Folder | How the type is defined |
|---|---|
| `Domain Types/` (PostgreSQL) | **Declared** — a `.json` file SchemaSmith compares and converges |
| `Enum Types/` (PostgreSQL) | **Declared** — same, with value ordering preserved |
| `Composite Types/` (PostgreSQL) | Scripted — a `.sql` file in the folder |
| `DataTypes/` (SQL Server) | Scripted — a `.sql` file in the folder |

> **Prefer the declared form where one exists.** A scripted type is a guarded `CREATE` — `CREATE TYPE … IF NOT EXISTS` or its equivalent — which runs once and then silently does nothing on every later deploy. Editing the value list or the domain's `CHECK` in the `.sql` changes nothing while the run still reports success. A declared type is compared against the database each deploy, so an edit actually converges.

### Computed/generated columns

```json
{ "Name": "FullName", "ComputedExpression": "[FirstName] + ' ' + [LastName]", "Persisted": true }
```

(SQL Server uses `ComputedExpression`; PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB use `GenerationExpression` with the platform's syntax.)

## Memory-Optimized Tables (SQL Server)

A memory-optimized (In-Memory OLTP, "Hekaton") table lives in memory rather than on disk pages, with a
lock-free concurrency model that removes the latch and lock contention a hot table hits under load. SQL Server
asks a lot in return: the table is built differently, its indexes are declared differently, and almost nothing
about it can be altered afterwards. SchemaSmith declares the whole shape in one table file — the engine
choice, the durability, and the inline indexes — and **refuses by name** the changes SQL Server cannot make,
rather than emitting DDL that would fail halfway.

> **SQL Server only:** In-Memory OLTP has no equivalent on PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MariaDB. No parity gap —
> there is no cross-platform analogue to implement.

Set `MemoryOptimized: true` on the table, and `Durability` if you want `SCHEMA_ONLY`. Indexes are declared
exactly as they are on any other table; SchemaSmith emits them inline because that is what SQL Server requires.

```json
{
  "Schema": "[dbo]",
  "Name": "[SessionCache]",
  "MemoryOptimized": true,
  "Durability": "SCHEMA_ONLY",
  "Columns": [
    { "Name": "[SessionId]", "DataType": "BIGINT", "Nullable": false },
    { "Name": "[Payload]", "DataType": "NVARCHAR(4000)", "Nullable": true }
  ],
  "Indexes": [
    { "Name": "[PK_SessionCache]", "IndexColumns": "[SessionId]", "PrimaryKey": true, "Unique": true, "BucketCount": 1000000 }
  ]
}
```

### Prerequisites

The database needs a `MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_DATA` filegroup and the server needs In-Memory OLTP support. **SchemaSmith
creates neither, and does not degrade the table to a disk table when they are missing** — it stops before any
DDL runs, naming the table:

> Table `X` is memory-optimized, but this database cannot host one: it needs In-Memory OLTP support
> (`SERVERPROPERTY('IsXTPSupported') = 1`) and a `MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_DATA` filegroup.

> **Why it fails instead of degrading.** Quietly deploying a disk table would change the table's durability
> and concurrency semantics while reporting success — the application would run against something that is not
> what the package asked for. Add the filegroup in a migration script, supplying the environment-specific path
> through [script tokens](script-tokens.md), or drop `MemoryOptimized`.

### Indexes are inline

SQL Server rejects `CREATE INDEX` against a memory-optimized table, so every index is emitted inside the
`CREATE TABLE` statement. Declare them in the ordinary `Indexes` array and SchemaSmith places them correctly —
a primary key becomes `PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED`, and an index with a `BucketCount` becomes a `HASH` index.
`CompressionType` and `XmlCompression` are ignored here; neither applies to a memory-optimized table.

### What is refused

Because SQL Server has no `ALTER` for any of it, SchemaSmith reports these by name and stops rather than
attempting them. Each is a table recreate — do it in a migration script.

| Change | Why it cannot be applied |
|---|---|
| `MemoryOptimized` on or off | No `ALTER` converts a table to or from the In-Memory engine. |
| `Durability` | No `ALTER` for a memory-optimized table's durability. |
| Adding, removing, or altering an inline index | Memory-optimized indexes are immutable through ordinary `CREATE`/`DROP INDEX` — including a uniqueness change or a change of key columns. |
| `BucketCount` | Same immutability. Comparison allows for SQL Server rounding the count up to the next power of two, so only a genuine change is reported. |

### Ownership

Every other SQL Server table carries its SchemaSmith ownership in a `ProductName` extended property.
**Memory-optimized tables reject extended properties outright**, so ownership for them is recorded in a
`SchemaSmith.ProductOwnership` table in the target database instead. This is a storage change, not a
behaviour change: drop-by-absence, cross-product protection and `PreventDrop` all work exactly as they do
elsewhere, because the ownership rows are folded into the same comparison the extended-property scan feeds.
Rows for tables that no longer exist are pruned on each deploy.

### Placement cannot be combined

A memory-optimized table lives in the `MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_DATA` filegroup, so it cannot also declare
`FileGroup`, `TextImageFileGroup`, `FileStreamFileGroup`, or `PartitionScheme`. [`--Validate`](validate.md)
reports that combination as `SS-XTP-001` before you deploy.

## Always Encrypted (SQL Server)

Always Encrypted lets SQL Server store sensitive column data in encrypted form that the server itself cannot read — only authorized clients holding the Column Master Key can decrypt. SchemaTongs extracts encrypted columns and captures all three encryption properties; SchemaQuench declares them with the exact `ENCRYPTED WITH (…)` syntax SQL Server requires. Extract once, deploy everywhere the CMK is distributed — no hand-written DDL.

> **SQL Server only:** Always Encrypted is a SQL Server feature with no equivalent on PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MariaDB. No parity gap — there is no cross-platform AE analogue to implement.

### Column properties

These three properties appear on SQL Server column definitions only and are ignored on all other platforms.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `EncryptionType` | string | `"NONE"` | Encryption type: `"DETERMINISTIC"` (repeatable ciphertext, supports equality comparisons) or `"RANDOMIZED"` (non-repeatable ciphertext, stronger protection). `"NONE"` or absent means no encryption. |
| `EncryptionKey` | string | `""` | Column Encryption Key name, bracket-wrapped (e.g., `"[MyCEK]"`). Must match a CEK already installed in the target database. |
| `EncryptionAlgorithm` | string | `""` | Encryption algorithm name. The only currently supported value is `"AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256"`. |

When `EncryptionType` is not `"NONE"`, SchemaQuench emits `ENCRYPTED WITH (COLUMN_ENCRYPTION_KEY = [EncryptionKey], ENCRYPTION_TYPE = [EncryptionType], ALGORITHM = '[EncryptionAlgorithm]')` in the column DDL.

### Example

```json
{
  "Name": "[Customer]",
  "Schema": "[dbo]",
  "Columns": [
    { "Name": "[CustomerId]",  "DataType": "INT",          "Nullable": false },
    { "Name": "[SSN]",         "DataType": "NVARCHAR(11)", "Nullable": false,
      "Collation": "Latin1_General_BIN2",
      "EncryptionType": "DETERMINISTIC",
      "EncryptionKey": "[CustomerCEK]",
      "EncryptionAlgorithm": "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256" },
    { "Name": "[Notes]",       "DataType": "NVARCHAR(500)", "Nullable": true,
      "EncryptionType": "RANDOMIZED",
      "EncryptionKey": "[CustomerCEK]",
      "EncryptionAlgorithm": "AEAD_AES_256_CBC_HMAC_SHA_256" }
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** Encrypted columns require a BIN2 collation (e.g., `Latin1_General_BIN2`) on character types. SQL Server enforces this — a non-binary collation on an encrypted column fails at DDL execution time.

### Works and limitations

**Declaring encrypted columns and extracting them both work.** Add new encrypted columns to a table JSON; SchemaQuench creates them with the declared CEK, type, and algorithm. SchemaTongs extracts existing encrypted columns and maps `EncryptionType`, `EncryptionKey`, and `EncryptionAlgorithm` correctly, so an extract-then-deploy round-trip is faithful.

**Changing the encryption settings on a populated column is not supported in-quench.** If you change `EncryptionType`, `EncryptionKey`, or `EncryptionAlgorithm` on a column that already has data — or add `EncryptionType` to a column that was previously plaintext — SchemaQuench raises a hard error before any DDL runs, names the column, and points you at the workaround. The column is left untouched.

This is a fundamental SQL Server constraint, not a tooling limitation. A standard (non-enclave) SQL Server holds no Column Master Key and cannot decrypt or re-encrypt data server-side; re-encryption requires client-side key access that SchemaQuench does not have. The guard fires in both live and WhatIf mode so the constraint is visible in previews before any deployment runs.

**Workaround — Before/After full-table rebuild:**

1. **Before script:** create the new table with the target encrypted schema; `INSERT INTO new SELECT * FROM old` over a `Column Encryption Setting=Enabled` connection (the ADO.NET driver handles decrypt/re-encrypt client-side); drop foreign keys and constraints on the old table; drop the old table; `sp_rename` the new table.
2. **After script:** recreate foreign keys, constraints, and extended properties.

This is the same approach SQL Server Management Studio uses for Always Encrypted changes. Run it in a maintenance window — referential integrity is briefly broken between the Before and After steps.

## Indexes

Every entry in the `Indexes` array defines an index or key constraint on the table. The shared shape covers the common cases; per-platform index types extend it.

### Shared index properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | | Index or constraint name. |
| `PrimaryKey` | bool | `false` | `true` for a primary key constraint. |
| `Unique` | bool | `false` | `true` for a unique index. |
| `UniqueConstraint` | bool | `false` | `true` for a UNIQUE constraint (as opposed to a unique index). |
| `IndexColumns` | string | | Comma-separated column names with optional sort direction. |
| `IncludeColumns` | string | | Comma-separated INCLUDE/covering columns where supported. |
| `FilterExpression` | string | | Filtered/partial index WHERE clause. |
| `ShouldApplyExpression` | string | | Conditional inclusion. See [Conditional Application](#conditional-application). |
| `VariantName` | string | | Optional label for a conditional variant. Appears in deployment log messages when the variant applies, and documents the intent behind the `ShouldApplyExpression`. Max 128 characters. |
| `Extensions` | object | `null` | Custom metadata. See [Custom Properties](custom-properties.md). |

### SQL Server index extras

`CompressionType` (NONE/ROW/PAGE), `Clustered`, `ColumnStore`, `FillFactor`, `UpdateFillFactor`,
`FileGroup`, `PartitionScheme`, `PartitionColumn`, `IgnoreDuplicateKey`, `PadIndex`, `BucketCount`.

| Property | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `BucketCount` | int | `null` | Only for an index on a [memory-optimized table](#memory-optimized-tables-sql-server). Setting it makes the index a **hash** index (`HASH … WITH (BUCKET_COUNT = n)`); leaving it unset makes it a range index. Size it at roughly one to two times the number of distinct key values — too few buckets lengthens the collision chains, too many wastes memory. SQL Server rounds the count **up to the next power of two**, so a declared `1000` deploys as `1024` and SchemaSmith compares the two as equal rather than churning. **Changing it on a deployed table is refused**, along with any other inline-index change. |

`FileGroup` follows the same name-only, unset-means-unmanaged contract as the table property above. Worth knowing when declaring one on a table but not its indexes: an index created with no filegroup of its own follows **its table**, not the database default. An index is declared independently of its table's filegroup, which is what lets you keep a large table's data and its indexes on separate storage.

`PartitionScheme` and `PartitionColumn` work the same way, and are read independently of the table's own placement — an index is **not** required to be aligned with its table. A nonclustered index on a partitioned table may sit on a single filegroup, and an index on an ordinary heap may itself be partitioned; both are real designs, so neither is inferred from the other. As on the table, a declared scheme that differs from where the index already lives is refused rather than rebuilt.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `IgnoreDuplicateKey` | bool | `false` | `IGNORE_DUP_KEY`. **This changes what your application sees, not how fast it runs.** With it off (the default), inserting a duplicate into a unique index fails the whole statement with error 2601 and nothing is written. With it on, the duplicate row is discarded with a warning and **the rest of the statement succeeds** — so a multi-row `INSERT` containing one duplicate lands the other rows instead of rolling back. Only valid on a unique index or unique constraint. |
| `PadIndex` | bool | `false` | `PAD_INDEX` — applies `FillFactor` to the intermediate index pages as well as the leaf pages. Has no effect without a `FillFactor`, which is why it is declared alongside it rather than on its own. |

**On indexed views:** SQL Server rejects `IGNORE_DUP_KEY` on a view index outright ("Cannot define an index on a view with ignore_dup_key index option"), so there is nothing to declare there. `PadIndex` **is** supported on an index inside an `Indexed Views/` definition.

### PostgreSQL index extras

`AccessMethod` (e.g., `btree`, `gin`, `gist`), `IncludeColumns` (PostgreSQL 11+ covering indexes), `Tablespace`, and `StorageParameters`.

`StorageParameters` is an open `{ "key": "value" }` map carrying the index's `WITH (...)` storage options, so
each access method's own options are expressible without SchemaSmith maintaining a list of them — PostgreSQL
validates each key against the access method at create time and reports a bad one itself. Leave it unset and
storage options are unmanaged.

```json
{ "Name": "[IX_Doc_Tags]", "IndexColumns": "[Tags]", "AccessMethod": "gin", "StorageParameters": { "fastupdate": "off" } }
```

> **Not the place for `fillfactor`.** It has its own `FillFactor` property, which converges in place through
> `ALTER INDEX … SET`. SchemaSmith keeps it out of this map so the two cannot disagree.

**A change here rebuilds the index rather than altering it.** Some options genuinely cannot be altered in
place — `hnsw`'s `m` and `ivfflat`'s `lists` among them — so rather than converging the ones that can and
silently ignoring the ones that cannot, any difference in the set drops and recreates the index. The
comparison is order-insensitive, because PostgreSQL returns `reloptions` in its own order.

`Tablespace` places the index. An index does **not** follow its table's tablespace — created with no clause it lands wherever `default_tablespace` points, which is usually but not always the same place. Omitting it means placement is **not managed**, which is not the same as declaring the database default: an index a DBA placed by hand is left exactly where it is. Create-time only — moving an existing index rebuilds it, so a declared tablespace that differs from where the index already lives is refused by name rather than performed.

### MySQL index extras

`IndexType` (e.g., `BTREE`, `HASH`), `Visible`/`Invisible` flag where supported.

### Examples

```json
// Primary key (SQL Server)
{ "Name": "[PK_Product_ProductID]", "PrimaryKey": true, "Unique": true, "Clustered": true, "IndexColumns": "[ProductID]" }

// Filtered unique index (PostgreSQL)
{ "Name": "ux_customer_email_active", "Unique": true, "IndexColumns": "email", "FilterExpression": "is_active = true" }

// Covering index (SQL Server)
{ "Name": "[IX_Customer_Name]", "IndexColumns": "[LastName] ASC, [FirstName] ASC", "IncludeColumns": "[Email], [Phone]" }
```

## Foreign Keys

Referential integrity lives in the table JSON alongside columns and indexes, not in separate migration scripts. The `ForeignKeys` array captures each relationship: the local columns, the related table they reference, and the optional cascade actions for deletes and updates. SchemaQuench reads the array, diffs it against the live database, and adds, drops, or recreates constraints to match.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | | Constraint name. |
| `Columns` | string | | Comma-separated local column names. |
| `RelatedTableSchema` | string | platform default | Schema of the referenced table (`dbo` on SQL Server, `public` on PostgreSQL, omitted on MySQL). |
| `RelatedTable` | string | | Referenced table name. |
| `RelatedColumns` | string | | Comma-separated referenced column names. |
| `DeleteAction` | string | `null` | `"NO ACTION"`, `"CASCADE"`, `"SET NULL"`, `"SET DEFAULT"`, or `"RESTRICT"` where supported. |
| `UpdateAction` | string | `null` | Same values as `DeleteAction`. |
| `ShouldApplyExpression` | string | | Conditional inclusion. |
| `VariantName` | string | | Optional label for a conditional variant. Appears in deployment log messages when the variant applies, and documents the intent behind the `ShouldApplyExpression`. Max 128 characters. |
| `Extensions` | object | `null` | Custom metadata. |

For composite foreign keys, list all columns in both `Columns` and `RelatedColumns` in matching order.

### FKs in schema templates

In a schema template, `RelatedTableSchema` is optional when the referenced table lives in the same iteration schema. If you omit it, SchemaQuench resolves it to `{{SchemaName}}` at runtime -- so `FK_Orders_Customer` with no `RelatedTableSchema` wires up correctly to `acme.Customers` during the `acme` iteration without any extra configuration.

For foreign keys that cross schema boundaries -- for example, a tenant's `Orders` table referencing `dbo.Countries` on SQL Server or `public.countries` on PostgreSQL -- set `RelatedTableSchema` explicitly to the target schema name. That explicit literal is preserved as-is through every iteration.

```jsonc
{
  "Name": "FK_Orders_Country",
  "Columns": "CountryCode",
  "RelatedTable": "Countries",
  "RelatedTableSchema": "[dbo]",
  "RelatedColumns": "Code"
}
```

For a complete cross-schema FK example with both same-iteration and cross-schema references in one table, see the [Multi-Tenant Deployments](../guide/10-multi-tenant-deployments.md#cross-schema-references) chapter.

## DataDelivery

Lookup tables, configuration rows, the reference data every environment needs to run -- that data is a schema-management problem as much as the tables themselves. The `DataDelivery` block declares how those rows land in the target database, alongside the table definition, so reference data travels with the schema it depends on.

Declare how a table's data gets merged into the target database and let SchemaQuench handle the rest. Add a `DataDelivery` block to the table JSON, point it at a `.tabledata` file, tell it what a "match" looks like, and SchemaQuench delivers the data in foreign-key order -- no hand-rolled merge scripts.

Tables without a `DataDelivery` block are left alone. Tables that declare one are picked up automatically during the data delivery step -- see [SchemaQuench -- Table Data Delivery](schemaquench.md#table-data-delivery) for the runtime behavior.

### Properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ContentFile` | string | | Path to the row data, relative to the template root. Typically produced by DataTongs as a `.tabledata` file (raw JSON array). |
| `ContentEncoding` | string | `Json` | Encoding of `ContentFile`: `Json` (default) or `Xml`. Accepted on every platform. See [Content Encoding](#content-encoding) below. |
| `MergeType` | string | | One of `Insert`, `Insert/Update`, `Insert/Update/Delete`. See [MergeType](#mergetype) below. |
| `MatchColumns` | string | | Comma-separated column names that identify a row. Prefix a column with `*` for NULL-safe comparison on nullable keys. Matches the `KeyColumns` concept in DataTongs. |
| `MergeFilter` | string | `""` | Optional SQL `WHERE` clause (without the `WHERE` keyword). Scopes both the rows considered for matching and, when delete is enabled, the rows eligible for deletion. |
| `MergeDisableTriggers` | bool | `false` | Wrap the merge with platform-appropriate trigger disable/enable. |
| `MergeDisableRules` | bool | `false` | **PostgreSQL.** Disable rewrite rules on the table during the merge. |
| `MergeUpdateDescendents` | bool | `false` | **PostgreSQL.** When `true`, the merge targets descendant partitions as well as the specified table. When `false` (the default), the merge uses `ONLY` so descendant tables are left untouched. |
| `ShouldApplyExpression` | string | `""` | Optional SQL predicate evaluated against the target at deploy time. Tokens are resolved before evaluation -- including [`{{ServerMajorVersion}}` and `{{CompatibilityLevel}}`](script-tokens.md#servermajorversion-and-compatibilitylevel), the same version tokens a folder or table gate can reference. Blank or absent always applies -- today's unchanged behavior. When `DataDelivery` is an array of two or more deliveries, every entry must set one. See [Multiple Deliveries](#multiple-deliveries) below. |
| `VariantName` | string | `""` | Optional label naming the intent behind a delivery's `ShouldApplyExpression`. Appears in the deployment log when that delivery is skipped or when its gate errors. Max 128 characters. |

### MergeType

| Value | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `Insert` | Missing rows inserted. Existing rows and extra rows left alone. The seed-data pattern. |
| `Insert/Update` | Missing rows inserted, changed rows updated. Extra rows left alone. Good for reference tables where environments can append local rows. |
| `Insert/Update/Delete` | Full sync. Missing rows inserted, changed rows updated, and target rows that don't exist in the source data are deleted. The demo products use this. When `MergeFilter` is set, deletes are scoped by the filter so rows outside it are never removed. |

The chosen idiom is platform-specific -- `MERGE` on SQL Server and PostgreSQL, `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` with a conditional delete step on MySQL -- but the declarative contract is the same on every platform.

### Content Encoding

`ContentEncoding` selects how SchemaQuench shreds the `ContentFile`, and every platform accepts `Xml` -- but the reason to reach for it, and how it's actually applied, differs by engine.

On **SQL Server**, the default `Json` encoding shreds the content with `OPENJSON`, which requires compatibility level 130 (SQL Server 2016+). If your target database is left at an older compatibility level (100--120, common where a line-of-business app is certified against an older level), a JSON delivery cannot run there. Set `"ContentEncoding": "Xml"` and SchemaSmith shreds the payload with the XML data-type methods (`.nodes()` / `.value()`) instead -- a path that works at every compatibility level -- so the same package's data deploys on a legacy target. Clearing that cliff is the real reason to choose `Xml` on SQL Server.

On **PostgreSQL**, `Xml` is shredded natively with `xmltable()` at every supported version -- there's no compatibility cliff to route around there, so it's a stylistic choice rather than a necessity.

On **MySQL and MariaDB**, neither engine can shred XML dynamically (both reject a non-constant XPath outright), so SchemaSmith converts an `Xml`-encoded payload to JSON once, up front, and shreds the result exactly as it would a hand-authored JSON payload. Declaring `Xml` there buys authoring uniformity for a schema package shared across engines -- not a version-reach benefit, since MySQL/MariaDB never had a compatibility-level cliff to begin with.

The two encodings are not interchanged automatically: the payload is your data, in a shape SchemaSmith does not own, so you choose the encoding per delivery and SchemaSmith shreds whichever you declared. A `Json` delivery aimed at a below-130 SQL Server target follows the [unsupported-feature policy](schemaquench.md#version-adaptive-code-generation) -- `warn` (the default) skips just that delivery with a clear message and delivers the rest; `fail` aborts.

The XML row shape is a documented, stable contract -- one `<c>` element per column, named by an `n` attribute so any column name (including `[Order Date]`) is carried verbatim:

```xml
<rows>
  <row><c n="code">A001</c><c n="name">Widget</c><c n="price">7.25</c></row>
  <row><c n="code">B002</c><c n="name">Gadget</c></row>
</rows>
```

- An **absent `<c>`** is `NULL` (row `B002` above has no `price`).
- **Binary** columns are base64; **geometry/geography** is WKT with a companion `<c n="Column.STSrid">` carrying the SRID (produced on SQL Server; see the [extraction note](datatongs.md#delivery-encoding-xml-for-legacy-sql-server) for when the other engines omit it); **dates** are ISO-8601.

You don't have to hand-author this shape: `DataTongs --DeliveryEncoding=Xml` extracts a table's data directly in it and stamps `"ContentEncoding": "Xml"` on the delivery for you, on every source engine (see [DataTongs](datatongs.md#delivery-encoding-xml-for-legacy-sql-server)) -- SQL Server extracts XML natively, and PostgreSQL/MySQL/MariaDB convert their normal JSON extraction into the identical shape. One caveat: the `.STSrid` SRID element -- a per-row companion carried alongside each extracted value -- is captured only in SQL Server's extraction; PostgreSQL and MySQL JSON (and therefore their XML derivatives) carry WKT alone for spatial columns, the same as their JSON output. On **MySQL**, a [SRID-restricted column](#mysql-column-extras) (`Srid` in the schema package) doesn't need that per-row companion: every row in the column is guaranteed to carry the declared reference system, so a deploy target reconstructs it from the schema instead. An *unrestricted* MySQL spatial column, and every PostgreSQL spatial column, still lose the reference system in data extraction.

### Multiple Deliveries

A table's `DataDelivery` is either a single object (the form above, unchanged) or an **array of independently-gated deliveries**. Each array entry is a full `DataDelivery` object -- its own `ContentFile`, `MergeType`, `MergeFilter`, and the rest. This is the mechanism behind three common patterns:

- **Environment-gated seed/test data.** Ship fixture or test rows that only land in dev or test databases.
- **Per-environment variants.** A rich dataset for dev, a minimal reference set for production -- same table, mutually exclusive gates.
- **Additive patch slices.** Several deliveries with disjoint `MergeFilter`s, each covering its own slice of the table, all applying together.

Unlike the single-match variant pattern used elsewhere in the schema package (see [Full-Text Index](#full-text-index-sql-server)), data deliveries are **not** "one match wins": at quench time, **every** delivery whose `ShouldApplyExpression` passes applies, in declared order. That's what makes additive patch slices possible -- and it's why an array of two or more deliveries requires a `ShouldApplyExpression` on every entry (an ungated entry alongside others would always apply, defeating the point of gating); loading an array that omits one on any entry fails with a clear error before any deployment work begins.

**Pattern 1 -- environment-gated seed data (SQL Server, bare-object form):**

```json
"DataDelivery": {
  "ContentFile": "data/dbo.TestFixtures.tabledata",
  "MergeType": "Insert/Update/Delete",
  "MatchColumns": "[FixtureId]",
  "ShouldApplyExpression": "DB_NAME() LIKE '%_dev' OR DB_NAME() LIKE '%_test'",
  "VariantName": "Dev/test fixtures"
}
```

A single delivery can carry a `ShouldApplyExpression` on its own -- no array required. This table's fixture rows only merge into databases whose name ends `_dev` or `_test`; everywhere else, delivery is skipped for this table.

**Pattern 2 -- per-environment variants (PostgreSQL, mutually exclusive gates):**

```json
"DataDelivery": [
  {
    "ContentFile": "data/public.product_catalog.dev.tabledata",
    "MergeType": "Insert/Update/Delete",
    "MatchColumns": "product_id",
    "ShouldApplyExpression": "current_database() = 'app_dev'",
    "VariantName": "Rich dev catalog"
  },
  {
    "ContentFile": "data/public.product_catalog.prod.tabledata",
    "MergeType": "Insert/Update",
    "MatchColumns": "product_id",
    "ShouldApplyExpression": "current_database() <> 'app_dev'",
    "VariantName": "Minimal prod reference set"
  }
]
```

The two gates are mutually exclusive, so exactly one variant applies per target -- a full catalog in dev, a lean reference set everywhere else -- from one table definition.

**Pattern 3 -- additive patch slices (MySQL, same gate, disjoint filters):**

```json
"DataDelivery": [
  {
    "ContentFile": "data/StatusCodes.core.tabledata",
    "MergeType": "Insert/Update/Delete",
    "MatchColumns": "StatusCodeId",
    "MergeFilter": "Category = 'Core'",
    "ShouldApplyExpression": "DATABASE() = 'app_main'",
    "VariantName": "Core status codes"
  },
  {
    "ContentFile": "data/StatusCodes.regional.tabledata",
    "MergeType": "Insert/Update/Delete",
    "MatchColumns": "StatusCodeId",
    "MergeFilter": "Category = 'Regional'",
    "ShouldApplyExpression": "DATABASE() = 'app_main'",
    "VariantName": "Regional status codes"
  }
]
```

Both deliveries share the same gate -- on `app_main`, both apply. Each is scoped to its own `Category` slice by `MergeFilter`, so the two additive deliveries never fight over the same rows.

> **Warning:** When two or more deliveries apply together to the same table and more than one uses `Insert/Update/Delete`, each delivery's delete pass removes any target row outside its own `MergeFilter` -- including rows another applying delivery just wrote. Give every `Insert/Update/Delete` delivery in a multi-delivery table a `MergeFilter` disjoint from every other applying delivery's filter, as in Pattern 3 above. There is no engine-side guard against overlapping deletes across deliveries; disjoint filters are an authoring responsibility.

A gated-off delivery is logged as skipped, distinct from a delivered or a failed one:

```
    Skipping data delivery for dbo.Orders [Dev/test fixtures] — ShouldApplyExpression evaluated false
```

In WhatIf mode, skipped deliveries are still logged individually with their `VariantName`, exactly as in a real run. Applied deliveries are reported as a single `Would DELIVER: <table>` line for the table, not broken out per delivery.

See [Conditional Application](#conditional-application) for the general `ShouldApplyExpression` behavior (blank/absent evaluates as always-apply, fail-closed error handling). Data delivery gates are evaluated the same way -- once per delivery instead of once per table -- with one difference worth knowing: component-level gates (columns, indexes, and the rest) and script-folder gates have their tokens (including `{{SchemaName}}` on schema templates) resolved before evaluation; a `DataDelivery.ShouldApplyExpression` does not currently go through that resolution step, so write it in terms of things you can query directly on the target (database/server name, catalog lookups) rather than a `{{Token}}` placeholder.

### FK-aware delivery

When multiple tables declare `DataDelivery`, SchemaQuench orders them by their declared foreign keys:

- **Pass 1** runs every table whose required (NOT NULL) FK parents are already loaded. Nullable FK columns that point to tables still awaiting delivery are deferred -- the pass-1 merge writes NULL into those columns and records the table for a second pass.
- **Pass 2** revisits each deferred table and back-fills the deferred columns with their actual values, now that every parent row exists.

This is automatic. You don't order the tables yourself; SchemaQuench computes the dependency graph from the `ForeignKeys` arrays in the table JSON. A cycle among NOT NULL foreign keys fails delivery with a clear log message -- break the cycle by making one side nullable, or separate the data load into explicit phases.

### Example

```json
{
  "Name": "[Employee]",
  "Schema": "HumanResources",
  "Columns": [
    { "Name": "[EmployeeID]",   "DataType": "INT IDENTITY(1,1)", "Nullable": false },
    { "Name": "[ManagerID]",    "DataType": "INT",          "Nullable": true },
    { "Name": "[DepartmentID]", "DataType": "INT",          "Nullable": false },
    { "Name": "[FullName]",     "DataType": "NVARCHAR(100)","Nullable": false }
  ],
  "Indexes": [
    { "Name": "[PK_Employee]", "PrimaryKey": true, "Unique": true, "IndexColumns": "[EmployeeID]" }
  ],
  "ForeignKeys": [
    { "Name": "[FK_Employee_Manager]",    "Columns": "[ManagerID]",    "RelatedTable": "[Employee]",   "RelatedColumns": "[EmployeeID]" },
    { "Name": "[FK_Employee_Department]", "Columns": "[DepartmentID]", "RelatedTable": "[Department]", "RelatedColumns": "[DepartmentID]" }
  ],
  "DataDelivery": {
    "ContentFile": "data/HumanResources.Employee.tabledata",
    "MergeType": "Insert/Update",
    "MatchColumns": "[EmployeeID]",
    "MergeDisableTriggers": true
  }
}
```

The self-referential `ManagerID` is nullable, so pass 1 loads every employee with `ManagerID = NULL`, and pass 2 back-fills the manager chain once every row exists. The mandatory `DepartmentID` forces `Department` to deliver first.

### Generating DataDelivery blocks with DataTongs

You don't have to write these blocks by hand. Point DataTongs at a source database with `--ConfigureDataDelivery` and it writes the `DataDelivery` section into each table JSON, including the match columns and merge type -- see [DataTongs -- --ConfigureDataDelivery](datatongs.md#--configuredatadelivery).

## Check Constraints

Table-level check constraints in the `CheckConstraints` array. Used when `CheckConstraintStyle` is `"TableLevel"` in `Product.json`, or when a check constraint spans multiple columns.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | | Constraint name. |
| `Expression` | string | | Boolean SQL expression. |
| `ShouldApplyExpression` | string | | Conditional inclusion. |
| `VariantName` | string | | Optional label for a conditional variant. Appears in deployment log messages when the variant applies, and documents the intent behind the `ShouldApplyExpression`. Max 128 characters. |
| `Extensions` | object | `null` | Custom metadata. |

When `CheckConstraintStyle` is `"ColumnLevel"` (the default), single-column check constraints are written as `CheckExpression` on the column instead. Multi-column constraints always use the `CheckConstraints` array.

### Per-platform behavior

A column-level check is a **round-trip** concern, not just a formatting preference: what a `cast` writes must survive a `quench` and come back the same way on the next `cast`. Each engine's catalog supports that differently.

| Engine | Column-level `CheckExpression` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SQL Server | Authored and extracted | `sys.check_constraints.parent_column_id` records that a check was declared on a column, so the split is exact. |
| PostgreSQL | Authored and extracted | A check named `CK_<table>_<column>` referencing exactly one column extracts onto that column. |
| MySQL / MariaDB | Table-level only | The catalog cannot attribute a check to a column. |

**PostgreSQL -- why the name matters.** PostgreSQL stores a column constraint and a table constraint identically (its documentation calls the column form "only a notational convenience"), so referencing one column is not evidence a check was *authored* column-level. Extraction therefore routes a single-column check onto its column only when it already carries the generated `CK_<table>_<column>` name. A check you named yourself -- `chk_status_positive` -- stays in `CheckConstraints` and keeps that name. This is deliberate: demoting it would rename it to the generated form on the next deploy, dropping and recreating the constraint on every run.

**MySQL / MariaDB -- table-level only.** `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CHECK_CONSTRAINTS` exposes a constraint's name and clause with no link back to a column, so a column-level check cannot be extracted as one -- it would come back table-level and change the package's shape on every cast. Author MySQL and MariaDB checks in the `CheckConstraints` array.

> A column `CheckExpression` in an existing MySQL or MariaDB package still works: it is migrated to a `CK_<table>_<column>` table-level constraint when the package loads, with a warning naming the columns to move. The deployed result is identical. The property is deprecated on these engines and will be removed -- move it to `CheckConstraints` at your convenience.

## XML Indexes (SQL Server)

XML index definitions in the `XmlIndexes` array. A primary XML index must be created before secondary XML indexes on the same column.

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | Index name. |
| `IsPrimary` | bool | `true` for a PRIMARY XML INDEX. |
| `Column` | string | Name of the XML column being indexed. |
| `PrimaryIndex` | string | Name of the primary XML index. Required for secondary indexes. |
| `SecondaryIndexType` | string | `"VALUE"`, `"PATH"`, or `"PROPERTY"`. Required for secondary indexes. |
| `ShouldApplyExpression` | string | Conditional inclusion. |
| `VariantName` | string | Optional label for a conditional variant. Appears in deployment log messages when the variant applies, and documents the intent behind the `ShouldApplyExpression`. Max 128 characters. |
| `Extensions` | object | Custom metadata. |

---

## Statistics (SQL Server / PostgreSQL)

Custom statistics definitions in the `Statistics` array. SQL Server uses traditional statistics; PostgreSQL uses extended statistics objects.

**SQL Server:**

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | Statistics name. |
| `Columns` | string | Comma-separated column names. |
| `SampleSize` | byte (0--100) | Sampling percentage. `0` means default sampling. |
| `FilterExpression` | string | Filtered statistics WHERE clause. |
| `ShouldApplyExpression` | string | Conditional inclusion. |
| `VariantName` | string | Optional label for a conditional variant. Appears in deployment log messages when the variant applies, and documents the intent behind the `ShouldApplyExpression`. Max 128 characters. |
| `Extensions` | object | Custom metadata. |

**PostgreSQL extended statistics** include kinds like `ndistinct`, `dependencies`, and `mcv`. The PostgreSQL statistic object adds `Kinds` and `Schema` fields.

---

## Change Data Capture (SQL Server)

Change Data Capture records inserts, updates, and deletes into a *change table* managed by SQL Server, so downstream readers can consume what happened rather than poll for differences. A table opts in with `"EnableCDC": true`. The tracked column set is fixed at the moment CDC is enabled, which is what makes schema change interesting: a capture instance created against three columns keeps capturing those three, whatever you do to the table afterwards.

> **Before you start:** CDC must be enabled on the *database* first (`EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_db`). SchemaSmith does not do that for you -- it changes retention, cleanup jobs, and storage for every table in the database, which is not a decision one table's package should make. Declare `EnableCDC` without it and the table still deploys, but capture is reported as downgraded and named in the deploy log rather than skipped in silence.

SQL Server's answer is to allow **two capture instances per table** so a new one can be stood up beside the old, and SchemaSmith uses exactly that. When a deploy changes the columns of a tracked table it:

1. Leaves CDC running throughout -- the column work does not interrupt capture.
2. Creates a second capture instance covering the new column set, named `<schema>_<table>_2` (or the base `<schema>_<table>` if the surviving instance already carries the `_2` suffix).
3. Leaves the original instance and everything it has captured untouched, and names it in the deploy log along with the command to remove it.

> **Action required:** Retiring the old instance is your call, not SchemaSmith's -- only you know when your readers have drained it. Drop it with `EXEC sys.sp_cdc_disable_table @source_schema = N'<schema>', @source_name = N'<table>', @capture_instance = N'<name>'`.

> **Warning:** Because the old instance occupies one of the two slots, a **second** column change before you drop it has nowhere to rotate to. SchemaSmith refuses that deploy **before touching any column**, naming the tables at the limit and the command to clear them, so nothing is left half-applied. Drop the drained instance and re-run.

Setting `EnableCDC` back to `false` disables capture on the table outright, which drops its capture instances and their history. That is a deliberate opt-out rather than a side effect of a schema change.

---

## Change Tracking (SQL Server)

Change tracking answers a narrower question than [Change Data Capture](#change-data-capture-sql-server): *which rows changed since the version you last saw*, rather than a full history of what each change was. It is lighter, and it is the right tool when a downstream reader only needs to re-fetch the rows that moved. A table opts in with `"EnableChangeTracking": true`.

> **Before you start:** Change Tracking must be enabled on the *database* first (`ALTER DATABASE <db> SET CHANGE_TRACKING = ON (CHANGE_RETENTION = 2 DAYS, AUTO_CLEANUP = ON)`). SchemaSmith does not do that for you -- it sets retention and auto-cleanup for every table in the database. Declare `EnableChangeTracking` without it and the table still deploys, but tracking is reported as downgraded and named in the deploy log rather than skipped in silence.

The table also needs a **primary key** -- SQL Server refuses to enable change tracking without one. SchemaSmith enables tracking after it creates the table's indexes and constraints, so a primary key declared in the same package is already in place.

### Tracking which columns changed

`"TrackColumnsUpdated": true` records *which columns* changed rather than only that the row did, which lets a reader skip rows whose relevant columns are untouched. It costs extra tracking storage, so it is off by default.

> **Warning:** SQL Server has no in-place alter for this option -- changing it requires disabling and re-enabling change tracking, which **discards the tracking baseline**. Every consumer of that table must then re-synchronize in full, and `CHANGE_TRACKING_MIN_VALID_VERSION` reports the new baseline. SchemaSmith performs the change because you asked for it, and names the table and the consequence in the deploy log so the resynchronization is not a surprise.

Removing `EnableChangeTracking` (or setting it to `false`) disables tracking on the table, which likewise discards its tracking information.

### Not the full-text option

Full-text indexes carry an unrelated option also spelled `ChangeTracking`, with values `AUTO`, `MANUAL`, and `OFF` -- it governs how a full-text index refreshes, and has nothing to do with table change tracking. See [Full-Text Index (SQL Server)](#full-text-index-sql-server).

---

## FILESTREAM (SQL Server)

FILESTREAM stores a `VARBINARY(MAX)` column's value as a file on an NTFS filegroup instead of in the row, which suits large blobs — documents, images, media — that you want in the database's transactional and backup story without paying for them in every row read. Declare it with `"FileStream": true` on the column.

> **Before you start:** FILESTREAM must be enabled on the *server* (a Windows-level setting plus `sp_configure 'filestream access level'`) and the *database* must have a FILESTREAM filegroup. SchemaSmith creates neither — the server setting is not reachable from T-SQL at all, and creating the filegroup means choosing a filesystem path on the target, which belongs to whoever owns the database. Without them the column still deploys, as a plain `VARBINARY(MAX)`, and the storage change is reported as downgraded rather than applied in silence.

FILESTREAM is a Windows-only SQL Server feature — it is not supported on SQL Server on Linux at any version.

### The ROWGUIDCOL requirement is stricter than it looks

SQL Server requires the table to carry a non-null `UNIQUEIDENTIFIER` column with the `ROWGUIDCOL` property, **covered by a single-column PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint**. The part that catches people out:

| Covering the ROWGUIDCOL column with… | Accepted? |
|---|---|
| `"PrimaryKey": true` | yes |
| `"UniqueConstraint": true` | yes |
| `"Unique": true` (a unique *index*) | **no** |
| nothing | no |

A unique index looks equivalent and is not. Declare the covering index entry with `"UniqueConstraint": true`, and declare the ROWGUIDCOL column itself as part of its `DataType` — `"DataType": "UNIQUEIDENTIFIER ROWGUIDCOL"` — the same way `IDENTITY` is declared.

SchemaSmith does not invent the ROWGUIDCOL column for you. A column it added by itself would appear in no package and vanish on the next extract-and-redeploy round trip. Declaring FILESTREAM without a usable one fails with a message naming the exact package change to make, rather than SQL Server's error 5505, which mentions ROWGUIDCOL but never the constraint-versus-index distinction.

```json
{
  "Schema": "[dbo]",
  "Name": "[Document]",
  "Columns": [
    { "Name": "[Id]", "DataType": "INT", "Nullable": false },
    { "Name": "[RowGuid]", "DataType": "UNIQUEIDENTIFIER ROWGUIDCOL", "Nullable": false, "Default": "NEWID()" },
    { "Name": "[Content]", "DataType": "VARBINARY(MAX)", "Nullable": true, "FileStream": true }
  ],
  "Indexes": [
    { "Name": "[PK_Document]", "IndexColumns": "[Id]", "PrimaryKey": true, "Unique": true },
    { "Name": "[UQ_Document_RowGuid]", "IndexColumns": "[RowGuid]", "UniqueConstraint": true }
  ]
}
```

### Choosing the filegroup

`FileStreamFileGroup` names the table's `FILESTREAM_ON` filegroup. Leave it unset and the table uses the database's default FILESTREAM filegroup. It is effectively immutable: SQL Server refuses to reassign a table that already has one, so a declared name that differs from the deployed one fails rather than being quietly ignored — the same posture [`FileGroup`](#sql-server-sqlservertable) takes.

Note that dropping the last FILESTREAM column does **not** release the table's FILESTREAM filegroup assignment; the binding outlives the columns.

---

## Full-Text Index (SQL Server)

SQL Server allows one full-text index per table. Declare it as a single `FullTextIndex` object -- or as an **array of conditional variants** when different targets need different definitions, such as a different full-text catalog per region. At deploy time, each variant's `ShouldApplyExpression` runs against the target and the matching variant deploys.

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FullTextCatalog` | string | Name of the full-text catalog. |
| `KeyIndex` | string | Name of the unique index used as the full-text key. |
| `ChangeTracking` | string | `"OFF"`, `"MANUAL"`, or `"AUTO"`. |
| `StopList` | string | Name of a full-text stop list. |
| `Columns` | string | Comma-separated column specification, e.g. `"[Title],[Body] TYPE COLUMN [BodyType] LANGUAGE 1033 STATISTICAL_SEMANTICS"`. Each entry is a bracketed column name, optionally followed by `TYPE COLUMN [col]` (the column holding the document's file extension for a binary column), `LANGUAGE <lcid>` (the word breaker to tokenize with), and `STATISTICAL_SEMANTICS` (semantic key phrase and document similarity indexing). Order matters -- SQL Server expects exactly that sequence. |
| `ShouldApplyExpression` | string | Boolean SQL expression evaluated on the target; the index (or variant) applies only when it is true. |
| `VariantName` | string | Optional label for a conditional variant. Appears in deployment log messages when the variant applies, and documents the intent behind the `ShouldApplyExpression`. Max 128 characters. |
| `Extensions` | object | Custom metadata. |

**Variant rules:**

- **One match per target.** With more than one variant, *every* variant must declare a `ShouldApplyExpression`, and those expressions must be mutually exclusive on any given target. Two variants matching the same target fails the deployment with a clear error.
- **No match means none.** When no variant matches a target, the table behaves as if no full-text index were declared there -- any existing full-text index is removed.
- **No-op when unchanged.** When the deployed index already matches the selected variant, re-deployment performs no full-text work: no drop, no repopulation.
- **`LANGUAGE` extracts only when it differs from the column default.** SchemaTongs omits `LANGUAGE` for a column already indexed in the language its collation implies, so extracted packages stay uncluttered. A column with no collation (a binary document column indexed through `TYPE COLUMN`) always extracts its `LANGUAGE`, because it has no implied default to fall back on.
- **`STATISTICAL_SEMANTICS` needs the semantic database.** The clause requires SQL Server 2012 or later with the Semantic Language Statistics Database installed and registered on the instance; without it the server rejects the index with "semantic functionality is not available." SchemaSmith deploys and compares the clause on every supported SQL Server encoding, so declaring it does not force a rebuild on each deploy.

> **Note:** When no variant matches a target, an existing full-text index on that table is dropped -- the absence of a match is treated as "no full-text index here," not "leave it alone."

```json
"FullTextIndex": [
  {
    "FullTextCatalog": "[Catalog_ProdEast]",
    "KeyIndex": "[PK_Documents]",
    "Columns": "[Title],[Body]",
    "ShouldApplyExpression": "EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM dbo.RegionConfig WHERE Region = 'East')"
  },
  {
    "FullTextCatalog": "[Catalog_ProdWest]",
    "KeyIndex": "[PK_Documents]",
    "Columns": "[Title],[Body]",
    "ShouldApplyExpression": "EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM dbo.RegionConfig WHERE Region = 'West')"
  }
]
```

## Full-Text Indexes (MySQL)

MySQL allows **multiple** full-text indexes per table, so the property is `FullTextIndexes` (an array).

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | Index name. |
| `Columns` | string | Comma-separated column names. |
| `Parser` | string | Optional parser name (e.g., `"ngram"`). |
| `Comment` | string | Index comment. |
| `ShouldApplyExpression` | string | Conditional inclusion. |
| `VariantName` | string | Optional label for a conditional variant. Appears in deployment log messages when the variant applies, and documents the intent behind the `ShouldApplyExpression`. Max 128 characters. |
| `Extensions` | object | Custom metadata. |

---

## Exclude Constraints (PostgreSQL)

PostgreSQL exclusion constraints are declared in the `ExcludeConstraints` array.

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | Constraint name. |
| `AccessMethod` | string | Index access method backing the constraint (e.g., `"gist"`). |
| `ExcludeColumns` | array | One or more `{ "Column", "Operator" }` pairs. |
| `FilterExpression` | string | Optional WHERE clause. |
| `ShouldApplyExpression` | string | Conditional inclusion. |
| `VariantName` | string | Optional label for a conditional variant. Appears in deployment log messages when the variant applies, and documents the intent behind the `ShouldApplyExpression`. Max 128 characters. |
| `Deferrable` | bool | Whether the constraint is deferrable. |
| `InitiallyDeferred` | bool | Whether the constraint defers by default. |
| `Extensions` | object | Custom metadata. |

### Example -- non-overlapping reservation periods

```json
{
  "Name": "no_overlapping_reservations",
  "AccessMethod": "gist",
  "ExcludeColumns": [
    { "Column": "room_id",        "Operator": "="  },
    { "Column": "reserved_period", "Operator": "&&" }
  ]
}
```

---

## Row-Level Security Policies (PostgreSQL)

Row-level security policies are declared in the `Policies` array on a PostgreSQL table.

`RowLevelSecurity` and `Policies` are two halves of one feature. Enabling row-level security without
declaring a policy denies everything: PostgreSQL returns no rows to any user except the table owner. If a
table has `RowLevelSecurity` set, it needs at least one permissive policy to be readable.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | -- | Policy name. Required, and unique per table. |
| `Permissive` | string | `"PERMISSIVE"` | `"PERMISSIVE"` policies are OR-ed together; `"RESTRICTIVE"` policies are AND-ed on top of them. A table with only restrictive policies still returns nothing, because none of them grant access in the first place. |
| `Command` | string | `"ALL"` | Which statement the policy governs: `"ALL"`, `"SELECT"`, `"INSERT"`, `"UPDATE"`, or `"DELETE"`. |
| `Roles` | string | `"PUBLIC"` | Comma-separated roles the policy applies to. Roles are not created by SchemaSmith -- naming one that does not exist fails with PostgreSQL's own error. |
| `UsingExpression` | string | `null` | The `USING` expression: which existing rows are visible. Omit for an INSERT-only policy, where PostgreSQL does not accept one. |
| `WithCheckExpression` | string | `null` | The `WITH CHECK` expression: which new or updated rows are allowed. When omitted on a policy that has `UsingExpression`, PostgreSQL applies the `USING` expression to writes as well. |
| `ShouldApplyExpression` | string | `null` | Conditional inclusion. |
| `VariantName` | string | `null` | Optional label for a conditional variant. Max 128 characters. |
| `Extensions` | object | `{}` | Custom metadata. |

**Policies are dropped when they leave the package**, and unlike indexes and statistics there is no opt-out
flag. A policy left behind after it stops being declared is a live access-control rule that nobody
declared -- a stronger reason to converge than exists for a performance object.

**A changed expression is not detected.** PostgreSQL stores `USING` and `WITH CHECK` expressions
normalised, so comparing them against the declared text reports a change on every deploy. SchemaQuench
converges the *set* of policies -- creating declared policies that are missing and dropping ones that are
no longer declared -- but editing an expression on an existing policy has no effect. Rename the policy, or
remove it and add it back under a new name, to change an expression.

### Example -- tenant isolation

```json
{
  "Schema": "public",
  "Name": "invoice",
  "RowLevelSecurity": true,
  "Policies": [
    {
      "Name": "tenant_read",
      "Command": "SELECT",
      "Roles": "app_reader",
      "UsingExpression": "tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::int"
    },
    {
      "Name": "tenant_write",
      "Command": "INSERT",
      "Roles": "app_writer",
      "WithCheckExpression": "tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::int"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Indexed View JSON Format (SQL Server)

Indexed views are defined as JSON files in the `Indexed Views/` directory of each template. Each file defines one indexed view.

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | View name. |
| `Schema` | string | Schema name. Defaults to `"dbo"`. |
| `Definition` | string | The complete view definition SQL (the SELECT statement). |
| `Indexes` | array | Indexes on the view. An indexed view must have a unique clustered index. |
| `ShouldApplyExpression` | string | Conditional inclusion. |
| `VariantName` | string | Optional label for a conditional variant. Appears in deployment log messages when the variant applies, and documents the intent behind the `ShouldApplyExpression`. Max 128 characters. |
| `Extensions` | object | Custom metadata. |

### Example

```json
{
  "Name": "[vw_ProductInventory]",
  "Schema": "[Production]",
  "Definition": "SELECT p.ProductID, p.Name, SUM(i.Quantity) AS TotalQuantity, COUNT_BIG(*) AS CountRows FROM Production.Product p INNER JOIN Production.ProductInventory i ON p.ProductID = i.ProductID GROUP BY p.ProductID, p.Name",
  "Indexes": [
    {
      "Name": "[IX_vw_ProductInventory]",
      "Unique": true,
      "Clustered": true,
      "IndexColumns": "[ProductID]"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Sequence JSON Format (PostgreSQL)

Sequences live in the `Sequences/` directory of each template, which accepts both `.json` (declared and converged) and `.sql` (scripted, exactly as before).

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | | Sequence name. Required. |
| `Schema` | string | `"public"` | Schema name. |
| `DataType` | string | `"bigint"` | `smallint`, `integer` or `bigint`. |
| `Start` | long | `null` | The value the sequence starts from **when it is created**. This is not the current value — see below. |
| `Increment` | long | `1` | Step between values. Negative for a descending sequence. |
| `MinValue` | long | `null` | Omit for the type's natural minimum. |
| `MaxValue` | long | `null` | Omit for the type's natural maximum. |
| `Cache` | long | `1` | Values pre-allocated per session. Higher is faster but leaves larger gaps after a crash. |
| `Cycle` | bool | `false` | Wrap to `MinValue` after `MaxValue` instead of erroring. |

**The current value is never managed.** A sequence's position records which numbers have already been handed out, so it is data rather than schema. If a deploy reset it, the next insert would re-issue keys already in use. `Start` only applies when the sequence is created; SchemaSmith never issues `RESTART`, and extraction never captures the current value.

**Sequences the engine owns are not managed here.** A `serial` or `IDENTITY` column generates its own sequence, which belongs to that column's declaration; those are excluded from extraction.

```json
{
  "Name": "invoice_number_seq",
  "Schema": "public",
  "DataType": "bigint",
  "Start": 1000,
  "Increment": 1,
  "Cache": 1,
  "Cycle": false
}
```

---

## Domain Type JSON Format (PostgreSQL)

Domain types live in the `Domain Types/` directory of each template, which accepts **both** forms — `.json` (declared and converged) and `.sql` (scripted, exactly as before).

**Declaring a domain fixes a real trap.** There is no `CREATE OR REPLACE DOMAIN`, so a scripted domain is a guarded `CREATE DOMAIN` — and once the domain exists that guard skips. Editing the `CHECK` in the `.sql` file changes nothing at all, on every deploy, forever, and the run reports success. A declared domain is compared against the server and converged.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | | Domain name. Required. |
| `Schema` | string | `"public"` | Schema name. |
| `DataType` | string | | The underlying type, with its modifier where it has one — `integer`, `character varying(20)`, `numeric(10,2)`. Required. **Create-time only** — see below. |
| `NotNull` | bool | `false` | Converges in place via `ALTER DOMAIN … SET/DROP NOT NULL`. |
| `Default` | string | `null` | Default applied to a column of this domain that declares no default of its own. Converges in place. |
| `CheckConstraints` | array | `[]` | Named `CHECK` constraints — `{ "Name": "...", "Expression": "VALUE > 0" }`. Write the predicate alone, without the surrounding `CHECK (…)`. |

**Constraints converge as a set.** One the package declares and the server lacks is added; one the server has and the package no longer declares is dropped. Dropping is safe here in a way removing an enum value is not — it removes a validation rule, destroys no data, and cascades to nothing.

**Adding a constraint validates the data already there** and fails if any existing row violates it, naming the offending column. That is PostgreSQL protecting you, and SchemaSmith does not work around it.

**A base-type change is refused, not applied.** PostgreSQL has no `ALTER DOMAIN … TYPE` — it is a syntax error, not an unsupported operation — so the only way to deliver one is to drop the domain, which drops every column typed by it. SchemaSmith names both the declared and the deployed type and stops. Change it with a migration script.

**Name your constraints.** PostgreSQL generates a name (`<domain>_check`, then `_check1`, …) when one is declared without it, and the name is the identity used for comparison. Extraction always emits a name.

```json
{
  "Name": "positive_amount",
  "Schema": "public",
  "DataType": "numeric(10,2)",
  "NotNull": true,
  "Default": "0",
  "CheckConstraints": [
    { "Name": "positive_amount_nonneg", "Expression": "VALUE >= 0" }
  ]
}
```

---

## Enum Type JSON Format (PostgreSQL)

Enum types live in the `Enum Types/` directory of each template, which accepts **both** forms — `.json` (declared and converged) and `.sql` (scripted, exactly as before).

**Declaring an enum fixes a real trap.** A scripted enum is created by a guarded `CREATE TYPE`; once the type exists that guard skips, so editing the value list in the `.sql` file does nothing at all — silently, and on every future deploy. A declared enum has its value list compared, and missing values are added.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | | Type name. Required. |
| `Schema` | string | `"public"` | Schema name. |
| `Values` | array of string | | The labels, **in order**. Required. |

**Order matters.** PostgreSQL sorts and compares enum values by declared position, not alphabetically, so a value you add in the middle of the list is added in the middle of the type — not appended.

**Removing a value is reported, not performed.** PostgreSQL cannot remove or reorder an enum value without recreating the type, which would mean dropping every column that uses it. A value the package no longer lists is left in place and named in the deploy log and the change manifest, so the divergence is visible rather than silent.

```json
{
  "Name": "order_status",
  "Schema": "public",
  "Values": [ "draft", "submitted", "shipped", "cancelled" ]
}
```

## Partitioning (MySQL / MariaDB)

MySQL and MariaDB carry a table's partition definition in the table DDL itself — there is no separate scheme object to point at, the way SQL Server has one — so the package carries the whole definition.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Method` | string | | `RANGE`, `LIST`, `HASH`, `KEY`, `RANGE COLUMNS` or `LIST COLUMNS`. Required. The `COLUMNS` forms take a column **list** rather than an expression and compare values column by column. |
| `Expression` | string | | The partitioning expression (`Id`, `YEAR(created)`), or a comma-separated column list for the `COLUMNS` methods. Required. |
| `PartitionCount` | int | `null` | `HASH` and `KEY` only: how many partitions to spread across. `RANGE` and `LIST` name each partition individually instead. |
| `Partitions` | array | `[]` | `RANGE` and `LIST` only, **in declared order**. Each entry is `{ "Name": "...", "Values": "..." }` — `Values` is what follows `VALUES LESS THAN` for `RANGE` (a value, a tuple for `RANGE COLUMNS`, or `MAXVALUE`) or `VALUES IN` for `LIST`. |

**Order is part of the definition.** `RANGE` boundaries must ascend, and the engine rejects a definition where they do not, so the list is written and read in declared order rather than sorted.

**Applied when the table is created; a change on a deployed table is refused.** `ALTER TABLE … PARTITION BY` rewrites every row, and comparing two layouts cannot tell you whether a split or a merge was intended — so a declaration that disagrees with the deployed table names both and stops, rather than repartitioning your data on the strength of an edited file. Repartition manually, or correct the declaration to match.

**The comparison ignores backticks, whitespace and case**, because the engines do not agree on how they report a partition expression back: MySQL 5.7 returns the text you wrote, while MySQL 8, MariaDB 10.2 and MariaDB 11.4 all return a rewritten form (`year(`dt`)`). Without normalising, the same package would deploy on one engine and be refused on another.

**MySQL requires every `UNIQUE` and `PRIMARY KEY` to contain every partitioning column.** That is the engine's rule, not SchemaSmith's, and a definition breaking it fails with the engine's own error.

```json
{
  "Name": "`order_history`",
  "Columns": [
    { "Name": "`Id`", "DataType": "int", "Nullable": false },
    { "Name": "`Placed`", "DataType": "date", "Nullable": false }
  ],
  "Indexes": [
    { "Name": "PRIMARY", "PrimaryKey": true, "Unique": true, "IndexColumns": "`Id`" }
  ],
  "Partitioning": {
    "Method": "RANGE",
    "Expression": "Id",
    "Partitions": [
      { "Name": "p_early", "Values": "1000000" },
      { "Name": "p_rest",  "Values": "MAXVALUE" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Scheduled Event JSON Format (MySQL / MariaDB)

Scheduled events live in the `Events/` directory of each template. That folder accepts **both** forms:

- **`.json`** — declared. The event is compared against the server, converges when it differs, and can be removed when it leaves the package.
- **`.sql`** — scripted, exactly as before. Re-run on every deploy, never compared, never removed by absence.

Existing packages need no change. Declaring the same event both ways is reported as `SS-EVT-001`.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | | Event name. Required. |
| `Definition` | string | | The body after `DO`. A multi-statement body must be wrapped in `BEGIN … END` exactly as it would be in hand-written DDL. Required. |
| `ScheduleType` | string | `"EVERY"` | `"EVERY"` for a recurring event or `"AT"` for a one-shot. |
| `Interval` | string | `null` | For `EVERY`: the interval as a value and a unit, e.g. `"1 DAY"` or `"30 MINUTE"`. Compared case- and spacing-insensitively. |
| `ExecuteAt` | string | `null` | For `AT`: when the event runs, once. |
| `Starts` | string | `null` | Optional start of the recurrence window. **Omit it and the server's own start time is left alone.** MySQL fills in an unspecified `STARTS` with the moment the event was created, so treating that as declared would make every later deploy see a difference and recreate the event — resetting its schedule each time. Set this only if you want a fixed start. |
| `Ends` | string | `null` | Optional end of the recurrence window. |
| `Status` | string | `"ENABLE"` | `"ENABLE"`, `"DISABLE"` or `"DISABLE ON SLAVE"`. |
| `Preserve` | bool | `false` | When true the event survives its last run instead of dropping itself. Matches the engine default (`NOT PRESERVE`). |
| `Comment` | string | `null` | Event comment. |

Removing an event from the package drops it only when `DropEventsRemovedFromProduct` is on, and only for events SchemaSmith created — one made by hand, or by a scripted `Events/` file, is never removed.

```json
{
  "Name": "nightly_purge",
  "ScheduleType": "EVERY",
  "Interval": "1 DAY",
  "Status": "ENABLE",
  "Preserve": false,
  "Definition": "DELETE FROM audit_log WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL 90 DAY"
}
```

---

## Materialized View JSON Format (PostgreSQL)

Materialized views live in the `Materialized Views/` directory of each template.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Name` | string | | View name. |
| `Schema` | string | `"public"` | Schema name. |
| `Definition` | string | | The complete view definition SQL. |
| `WithData` | bool | `true` | Whether the materialized view is populated immediately. Set to `false` for `WITH NO DATA`. |
| `Tablespace` | string | `null` | Optional tablespace. |
| `AccessMethod` | string | `null` | Storage access method. |
| `Indexes` | array | `[]` | Indexes on the materialized view (uses the PostgreSQL index shape). |
| `ShouldApplyExpression` | string | | Conditional inclusion. |
| `VariantName` | string | | Optional label for a conditional variant. Appears in deployment log messages when the variant applies, and documents the intent behind the `ShouldApplyExpression`. Max 128 characters. |
| `Extensions` | object | | Custom metadata. |

### Example

```json
{
  "Name": "active_orders",
  "Schema": "public",
  "Definition": "SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_date, total FROM public.orders WHERE status = 'active'",
  "WithData": true,
  "Indexes": [
    {
      "Name": "ux_active_orders_id",
      "Unique": true,
      "IndexColumns": "order_id"
    }
  ]
}
```

A materialized view that should be skipped for non-production environments is one `ShouldApplyExpression` away.

---

## Conditional Application

Dev uses synthetic data and a lean index set. Staging mirrors production's footprint. Production carries the full reporting stack and the regulated columns. Without a declarative answer, those differences turn into per-environment file copies, branching pipelines, or hand-maintained deploy scripts -- the kind of drift that's fine until a column gets forgotten. `ShouldApplyExpression` is that declarative answer: a SQL fragment attached to a component that decides, at deployment time, whether the component should apply to the current target.

`ShouldApplyExpression` is the universal opt-in/opt-out switch on every component that supports it. The expression is a SQL fragment that returns a single scalar value. When SchemaQuench evaluates it before deploying that component, it considers the result false if it's `0`, the literal string `false`, or empty/null. Anything else means apply the component normally.

```json
{
  "Name": "[Orders]",
  "Extensions": { "Environment": "Production" },
  "Indexes": [
    {
      "Name": "[IX_Orders_Reporting]",
      "IndexColumns": "[ReportingDate]",
      "ShouldApplyExpression": "'{{Table.Environment}}' = 'Production'"
    }
  ]
}
```

The same property is available on tables, columns, indexes, foreign keys, check constraints, indexed views, materialized views, statistics, exclude constraints, full-text indexes, XML indexes, and data deliveries. Combined with [Custom Properties](custom-properties.md) and the rest of the [Script Tokens](script-tokens.md) feature surface, you can express deployment-time decisions declaratively without ever writing a separate per-environment script file.

Data deliveries are the one exception to "one match wins": when a table declares an array of deliveries, every one whose gate passes applies, in declared order -- see [Multiple Deliveries](#multiple-deliveries) for the pattern and the delete-overlap warning that comes with it.

---

## .json-schemas Folder

Your IDE can help you write correct JSON if you point it at the right schemas. The `.json-schemas/` directory at the package root contains JSON Schema definition files generated automatically by SchemaTongs **on the fly** from the live C# domain types -- no embedded files, no shipped artifacts, just a snapshot of the engine's exact current shape.

Each file carries a platform infix matching the package's platform -- `<platform>` is `sqlserver`, `postgresql`, `mysql`, or `mariadb`:

| File | Validates |
|---|---|
| `products.<platform>.schema` | `Product.json` |
| `templates.<platform>.schema` | `Template.json` |
| `tables.<platform>.schema` | Table JSON files (`Tables/*.json`) |
| `indexedviews.sqlserver.schema` | Indexed view JSON files (SQL Server packages) |
| `materializedviews.postgresql.schema` | Materialized view JSON files (PostgreSQL packages) |

Because the schemas are regenerated every time SchemaTongs writes a package, they always match the current engine. If you've hand-edited any of them to add a custom validation fragment under `Extensions`, that fragment is preserved through regeneration -- see [Custom Properties: JSON Schema Validation](custom-properties.md#json-schema-validation).

---

## ZIP Package Support

SchemaQuench can consume schema packages as ZIP archives. When the `SchemaPackagePath` configuration value points to a `.zip` file, SchemaQuench reads the package directly from the archive without extracting it to disk first.

Requirements:

- The ZIP must contain the standard schema package folder structure.
- The `Product.json` file must be at the root of the archive (not nested inside an extra directory).
- All relative paths within the package must match the standard layout described in [Complete Folder Structure](#complete-folder-structure).

This is useful for deployment pipelines where the schema package is built as a single artifact.

---

## Filesystem-Illegal Character Encoding

Object names can contain characters that are illegal in file paths on Windows, macOS, or Linux. SchemaTongs uses a percent-encoding scheme to safely map these names to filenames.

| Character | Encoded As |
|---|---|
| `\` | `%5C` |
| `/` | `%2F` |
| `:` | `%3A` |
| `*` | `%2A` |
| `?` | `%3F` |
| `"` | `%22` |
| `<` | `%3C` |
| `>` | `%3E` |
| `\|` | `%7C` |
| `%` | `%25` |

**Additional rules:**

- **Leading spaces and dots** are encoded (`%20` for space, `%2E` for dot) because many filesystems strip or reject them at the start of filenames.
- **Trailing spaces and dots** are similarly encoded.
- **Reserved Windows device names** (CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1--COM9, LPT1--LPT9) have their first character percent-encoded.

SchemaQuench decodes these filenames transparently when reading definitions. You generally don't need to worry about encoding unless you're creating JSON files by hand for tables with unusual names.

---

## Schema Templates

Schema templates fan a single declarative template out across multiple schemas inside one database. You write the template once -- tables, procedures, views, migration scripts -- and SchemaQuench runs it once per schema returned by the `SchemaIdentificationScript` query, injecting the active schema name as the `{{SchemaName}}` token at every step. The most common use is multi-tenant SaaS where each tenant owns their own schema, but any pattern that needs the same object shape replicated across schemas works the same way. For a full narrative walkthrough, see [Multi-Tenant Deployments](../guide/10-multi-tenant-deployments.md).

Schema templates are supported on **SQL Server and PostgreSQL only**. MySQL and MariaDB use a database-per-tenant model instead -- there is no sub-database schema namespace to fan out across. On MySQL and MariaDB the `SchemaIdentificationScript` field is still *accepted*, but only as a **deprecated backward-compat alias** for `DatabaseIdentificationScript` (they conflate schema and database): its value migrates into `DatabaseIdentificationScript` when that field is empty, a deprecation warning advises renaming, and no schema fan-out occurs. New MySQL and MariaDB packages should use `DatabaseIdentificationScript` directly.

### Discovery query

`SchemaIdentificationScript` is the mode switch. When this field is present and non-empty on a `Template.json`, the template becomes a schema template. The value is a SQL query that returns one column and any number of rows; each row is a schema name, and SchemaQuench runs the full template once per returned row.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SchemaIdentificationScript` | string | not present | Query returning one column, N rows. Each row is a schema name for one iteration. |

The query runs against each target database identified by `DatabaseIdentificationScript`. If both are present, the engine computes the full cross-product: every `(database, schema)` pair runs as an independent iteration. Token replacement applies to the query body before execution, so you can reference `{{ScriptTokens}}` or `<*Query*>` tokens in the discovery query itself.

The active schema name is available to every part of the iteration as `{{SchemaName}}` -- in table `Name` and `Schema` fields, in procedure and view SQL bodies, in migration script filenames, in `VersionStampScript`, and in user-defined script tokens. See [{{SchemaName}}](script-tokens.md#schemaname) in the Script Tokens reference for availability rules and resolution timing.

#### Reserved schema names

A small set of platform-built-in schemas can't be used as iteration targets. If your discovery query returns one of these names, the engine fails the iteration with an error naming the offending schema and pointing you at the "shared content lives in a regular template" remediation. The reserved sets are:

- **SQL Server:** `dbo`, `sys`, `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, `guest`, plus the fixed database roles that double as schemas (`db_owner`, `db_accessadmin`, `db_securityadmin`, `db_ddladmin`, `db_backupoperator`, `db_datareader`, `db_datawriter`, `db_denydatareader`, `db_denydatawriter`).
- **PostgreSQL:** `public`, `pg_catalog`, `pg_toast`, `information_schema`, plus any schema matching the `pg_temp_*` or `pg_toast_temp_*` wildcards (Postgres uses these for session-scoped temp objects).

Shared content (lookup tables, audit logs, dimension data) belongs in a regular template that runs once per database, not in a schema-template iteration. The reserved-name guard is the engine's way of catching a discovery query that accidentally returns `public` or `dbo` instead of a real tenant schema.

### Auto-create schemas

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CreateSchemaIfMissing` | bool | `false` | When `true`, the engine emits `CREATE SCHEMA` for any schema returned by `SchemaIdentificationScript` that does not yet exist on the target database. |

When `false` (the default), an iteration whose schema doesn't exist fails immediately with a clear error. This is the safer behavior: a typo in your discovery query should not silently create schemas in production.

> **Warning:** `CreateSchemaIfMissing: true` requires the deployment user to have `CREATE SCHEMA` permission on SQL Server or `CREATE` on the database on PostgreSQL. The default `false` is intentional fail-fast: if the discovery query returns an unexpected schema name, you want an error, not a new schema.

Set `CreateSchemaIfMissing: true` when you're running a fully automated onboarding pipeline and the deployment user is trusted to create schemas. Many teams prefer to create schemas via an explicit stored procedure (`OnboardTenant`) in the Shared template and leave this `false`.

### AllowParallel

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AllowParallel` | bool | `true` | When `false`, iterations of this schema template run serially regardless of the global `MaxThreads` setting. |

When `true` (the default), schema iterations can run in parallel up to the `MaxThreads` limit alongside iterations from other templates and databases. Parallel execution is safe: each iteration touches its own schema namespace and converges independently.

> **Tip:** Set `AllowParallel: false` to force this template's iterations to run one at a time -- useful to cap concurrent load on a resource-constrained target, or when the template's own migration scripts perform DDL that can't run concurrently. Parallel iteration is otherwise the production-realistic default; both TenantCRM demos ship `AllowParallel: true`.

### Failure isolation

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ContinueOnSchemaFailure` | bool | `true` | When `false`, the first failing schema iteration stops the dispatcher: no new iterations start, in-flight iterations drain, and subsequent templates in `TemplateOrder` do not run. |

When `true` (the default), a single schema iteration's failure does not abort the others -- remaining iterations continue and the product run exits non-zero after all iterations have completed or failed. This matches the database-level isolation behavior that most teams already rely on.

Set `ContinueOnSchemaFailure: false` for deployments where any single-tenant failure is a hard stop -- for example, a CI environment where partial deployment is worse than no deployment.

For the execution-flow detail and interaction with `MaxThreads`, see [ContinueOnSchemaFailure](schemaquench.md#continueonschemafailure) in the SchemaQuench reference.

### Complete example

This is the `TenantWorkspace/Template.json` from the SQL Server TenantCRM demo -- a real schema template with all four fields declared:

```json
{
  "Name": "TenantWorkspace",
  "DatabaseIdentificationScript": "SELECT [name] FROM master.sys.databases WHERE [name] = '{{TenantCRMDb}}'",
  "SchemaIdentificationScript": "SELECT [Name] FROM dbo.Tenants WHERE [Status] = N'Active' ORDER BY [Name]",
  "RequireAtLeastOneTarget": false,
  "CreateSchemaIfMissing": false,
  "AllowParallel": true,
  "ContinueOnSchemaFailure": true,
  "VersionStampScript": "PRINT 'TenantCRM TenantWorkspace [{{SchemaName}}] {{ReleaseVersion}}'",
  "ScriptFolders": [
    { "FolderPath": "Before Scripts", "QuenchSlot": "Before" },
    { "FolderPath": "Functions",      "QuenchSlot": "Objects", "ObjectType": "Functions" },
    { "FolderPath": "Views",          "QuenchSlot": "Objects", "ObjectType": "Views" },
    { "FolderPath": "Procedures",     "QuenchSlot": "Objects", "ObjectType": "Procedures" },
    { "FolderPath": "Triggers",       "QuenchSlot": "Objects", "ObjectType": "Triggers" }
  ]
}
```

`RequireAtLeastOneTarget: false` here handles a fresh installation where no tenants have been onboarded yet -- the schema template finds zero rows, treats it as a no-op, and the product run succeeds so the `Initialize` and `Shared` templates still complete. The PostgreSQL TenantCRM demo is identical in structure and ships `AllowParallel: true`, so tenants deploy concurrently.
