# SchemaSmith Community Documentation

Welcome to the shop. Everything you need to master SchemaSmith is here -- the guide walks you through it front to back, and the reference docs are always within arm's reach when you need the details. Pick a starting point and dig in.

SchemaSmith Community supports **SQL Server**, **PostgreSQL**, and **MySQL** as first-class peers. The same tools, the same schema package format, the same workflow -- pointed at whichever engine your team runs.

## Start Here

New to SchemaSmith? The guide takes you from "what is this?" to confidently managing databases. Start at the beginning and follow the thread:

**[Why SchemaSmith →](guide/01-why-schemasmith.md)**

## Get the Tools

Before the walkthrough, install SchemaSmith. One command per platform — Chocolatey on Windows, `.deb` / `.rpm` / `install.sh` on Linux and macOS. No .NET runtime to install.

## Demo Products

Nothing beats working with real data. The repository includes demo products you can extract, deploy, and explore against a local database container.

- **AdventureWorks** — real-world complexity
- **Chinook** — the classic media-store schema
- **Northwind** — the canonical getting-started schema
- **Sakila** — the DVD rental store schema

All four demos are deployed on all three platforms (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL) by the per-platform `docker-compose.yml` files under `Demos/`. Each one was extracted and deployed end-to-end with SchemaSmith tools.
