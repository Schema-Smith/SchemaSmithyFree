# Genuine-binary version sweep (pre-PR gate). LOCAL-ONLY: needs the four on-demand old SQL Server
# instances (C:\temp\sqlserver-oldbinaries\start-oldsql.ps1). CI has no genuine old binary.
#
# TWO DIFFERENT WIRINGS -- do not merge them:
#  1. Schema.IntegrationTests/GenuineOldBinary reads SmithySettings_SqlServer__* , so it must be
#     pointed at each old instance in turn. The folder now holds TWO fixture families with opposite
#     version predicates, so every instance both passes and skips some -- read the counts, not the
#     presence of skips:
#       * OldBinaryXml* prove the pre-2016 CREATE-time binding. They self-Ignore at 2016+, so they
#         run on 14330/14331/14332 and skip on 14333.
#       * Sql2016TemporalRetentionGateTests proves the 2016-only band where the JSON/STRING_AGG and
#         2017-catalog-column gates cross. It runs ONLY on major 13, so it skips on 14330/14331/14332
#         and runs on 14333. 14333 used to skip everything, which is exactly how two 2017-vs-2016
#         defects lived there unseen; an all-skip result on 14333 now means something is wrong.
#     Expected shape per instance: 4 passed / 4 skipped.
#  2. SchemaQuench's GenuineSql2008EmitGuardCert HARDCODES 127.0.0.1,14330 for its own work, but it
#     lives in the SqlServer namespace whose [SetUpFixture] provisions Always Encrypted keys. Point
#     the env vars at an old instance and that setup dies with "SQL Server instance in use does not
#     support column encryption" -- which looks like three product failures and is not. Run it with
#     the DEFAULT settings so the SetUpFixture reaches the modern container.
set -u

# The sweep is local-only and manual, which is exactly how it gets skipped -- and skipping it, not a gap
# in what it covers, is how two 2017-vs-2016 defects reached the v2.5.0 cut. Every run writes a record so
# "was this run, against what, with what result" is answerable from the repository months later rather
# than from somebody's memory of a terminal.
