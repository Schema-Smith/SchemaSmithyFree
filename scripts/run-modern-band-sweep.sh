# Modern-band SQL Server sweep. CI runs exactly ONE SQL Server leg (2019), which is neither the floor
# nor the latest, so 2017, 2022 and 2025 are covered nowhere. This points the real integration suite at
# each of them in turn, using containers -- the bands where a Linux image exists.
#
# DELIBERATELY SEPARATE FROM run-genuine-sweep.sh, and not folded into it:
#   run-genuine-sweep.sh is the PRE-PR gate. It takes minutes and must keep taking minutes, because the
#   failure mode that item exists to prevent is somebody SKIPPING it -- two 2017-vs-2016 defects reached
#   the v2.5.0 cut exactly that way. Bolting three full integration runs onto it would make it an
#   hours-long gate, and an hours-long gate before every PR gets skipped, which trades a known gap for
#   a worse one.
#   This script is the PRE-RELEASE breadth pass instead: run once per release, where hours are affordable.
#
# The bands are provisioned the way CI provisions its SQL Server: stock images ship NO full-text
# component, and every SQL Server fixture needs one. Without it each band failed 464/464 SchemaQuench
# tests in OneTimeSetUp with error 7609 -- a setup failure that reads exactly like a product failure.
# So each band installs mssql-server-fts, restarts, and provisions the semantic language statistics
# database before a single test runs. Any of those failing records the band as NOT RUN; none of them
# is allowed to degrade into a quiet pass.
#
# 2017 is deliberately still here. It was added because it caught a specific issue, and it can still
# be provisioned: 2017-latest is built on Ubuntu 18.04 (not 16.04), packages.microsoft.com still
# serves the 18.04/mssql-server-2017 list, and mssql-server-fts 14.0.3540.1 installs cleanly on it.
#
# Each band gets its own container and port so a leftover container from another band cannot silently
# answer for it -- the same failure shape as an all-skip reading as a pass.
