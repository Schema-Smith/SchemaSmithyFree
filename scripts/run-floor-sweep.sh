# Version-FLOOR sweep (pre-PR gate). LOCAL-ONLY convenience: stands up the oldest supported engine of
# each family with CI-identical credentials, runs that engine's integration category against it, and
# reports.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The demo containers everyone runs the gate against are all MODERN versions, so a green
# four-engine run says nothing about the supported floors. On 2026-09-02 four version-floor defects reached
# CI that way -- two of them killed kindling outright, so ZERO tests ran on MariaDB 10.2 and MySQL 5.7
# while the local gate reported 5,337 passing. It took six CI runs to land one PR. Every one of those
# defects reproduces here in under two minutes.
#
# NOT the learn-* sandbox containers: those are training-lab servers with no TestUser, and pointing the
# suite at them fails with "Access denied" that looks like a product problem.
#
# THE BUG FAMILY THIS CATCHES: a version-specific catalog column, system variable, or SQL construct
# referenced where the engine cannot resolve it. On MySQL/MariaDB that resolution happens at CREATE
# PROCEDURE time, so a runtime version guard does NOT protect you -- the mention alone is fatal and takes
# the whole kindle down. The fix is to name it only inside a string literal and PREPARE/EXECUTE it.
#
# Versions mirror continuous-integration.yml's matrices; keep them in sync when CI's floors move.
