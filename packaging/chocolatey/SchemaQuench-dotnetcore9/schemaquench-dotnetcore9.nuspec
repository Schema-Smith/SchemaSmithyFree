    <summary>Automates and simplifies the application of schema metadata to SQL Server.</summary>
    <description>## Shape. Strengthen. Succeed.

SchemaSmithy is a suite of opinionated, metadata-driven tools that treat **SQL Server schema** like source code—so your database can be versioned, automated, and deployed just like the rest of your tech stack.

## Why SchemaSmithy?

Instead of fragile migration scripts and guesswork, SchemaSmithy gives you:

- Schema-as-code clarity with editable metadata.
- Git-friendly workflows and full version control.
- DevOps-ready deployments for CI/CD.
- Domain modeling that maps cleanly to product ownership.

| Tool                           | Role                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [SchemaTongs](https://github.com/Schema-Smith/SchemaSmithyFree/wiki/SchemaTongs)   | Extracts schema metadata from SQL Server.                                                |
| [SchemaHammer](https://github.com/Schema-Smith/SchemaSmithyFree/wiki/SchemaHammer) | Edit and refactor metadata in a structured UI (available in the [[Enterprise Edition]]). |
| [SchemaQuench](https://github.com/Schema-Smith/SchemaSmithyFree/wiki/SchemaQuench) | Applies metadata to target servers with precision.                                       |

## Why Not Migrations?

Migration scripts tell the story of how your schema evolved, but they don’t tell you what it looks like *right now*. SchemaSmithy is **state-based**—your metadata repository defines the exact end state of your server at each release.

This means your SQL Server schema is always in sync with your source control. You gain full traceability, the ability to diff per-object changes between builds, and a clear history of *what changed*, *when*, and *why*.

Contrast that with traditional migrations, which require manually piecing together changes across multiple files to understand the final structure. With SchemaSmithy, the current state is always explicit.

## Define Product Boundaries

Use SchemaSmithy to:

- Easily model multiple applications or teams in a single server.
- Keep each domain isolated in its own metadata repository.
- Deploy different products at their own cadence depending on their rate of change.
