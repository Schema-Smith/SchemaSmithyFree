/// <summary>
/// Thin production loader for `--Validate`: reads the configured package from disk. Mirrors
/// <c>ProductQuench.LoadTemplates</c> minus the deploy-only special-token cross-resolution (the
/// linter only needs the loaded domain objects, not deployment-time token wiring). Integration-
/// covered in Slice 3 — not unit-tested here (would require a real package on disk).
/// <para>
/// Loads leniently on purpose — this is the one caller that passes
/// <see cref="MissingMemberHandling.Ignore"/> to BOTH <see cref="Product.Load"/> and
/// <see cref="Template.Load"/>, plus <c>tolerateComponentLoadErrors: true</c> and
/// <c>tolerateFileTokenErrors: true</c> to <see cref="Template.Load"/>. `--Validate`'s contract
/// (<c>SchemaPackageValidator</c>) is to enumerate every problem it can find in one pass; strict
/// deserialization aborts the whole run on the FIRST unrecognised property, hiding every other
/// finding a full pass would otherwise report. A misnamed property in either manifest is tolerated
/// at load time and reported precisely as SS-JSON-001 by <c>JsonSchemaCheck</c>'s independent
/// re-validation of the raw file, rather than aborting the load over it. A component file that
/// still fails to load outright (malformed JSON, not just an unknown property) is skipped the same
/// way. An unresolvable <c>&lt;*File*&gt;</c> ScriptTokens entry is likewise captured rather than
/// thrown, and turned into an SS-TOK-004 finding below — that gap used to vanish silently (neither
/// reported nor failing the run) because <see cref="TryLoadTemplate"/>'s catch used to discard the
/// exception <see cref="Schema.Utility.TokenHelper.ResolveFileTokens"/> raised unconditionally. A
/// template whose OWN manifest can't be loaded AT ALL (genuinely unparseable, or a
/// self-contradictory configuration) is the same failure shape one level up — see
/// <see cref="TryLoadTemplate"/> for how that's reported as SS-LOAD-002 instead of silently
/// excluding the template. The deploy path (<c>ProductQuench</c>) never sets any of these flags,
/// so an unrecognised property, a load failure, or an unresolvable file token there still aborts
/// the run as intended.
