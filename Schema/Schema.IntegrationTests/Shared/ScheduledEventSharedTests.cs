/// <summary>
/// MySQL/MariaDB scheduled events, promoted from a scripted-object folder to a MANAGED type (F4).
/// <para><b>What changes.</b> As a scripted object an event was re-run on every deploy (DROP then CREATE),
/// never compared, and never removed when it left the package — so a retired event kept firing until
/// someone dropped it by hand. Declared, it converges and can be dropped by absence.</para>
/// <para><b>Additive, deliberately.</b> The audit framed this as "removal-and-replace", which would break
/// every package that already has an <c>Events/</c> folder. Instead the same folder now holds
/// <c>.json</c> (declarative, managed) alongside <c>.sql</c> (scripted, exactly as before), so no existing
/// package changes behaviour and migration is per-event and optional.</para>
/// <para><b>The hard part is "unchanged".</b> ALTER EVENT cannot change every attribute and CREATE OR
/// REPLACE EVENT is MariaDB-only, so converging means DROP + CREATE. A comparison that reported a
/// difference when there was none would not merely churn — it would <i>reset the event's schedule on
/// every deploy</i>, which for a nightly job means pushing it past its window forever. The catalog and the
/// DDL disagree on spelling in four separate ways, and each one is a chance to get that wrong.</para>
