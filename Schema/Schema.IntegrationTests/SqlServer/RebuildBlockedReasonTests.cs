/// <summary>
/// SchemaSmith.fn_RebuildBlockedReason on SQL Server: the guard that decides whether a table may be
/// replaced by a shadow copy, and names the live state that forbids it when it may not.
///
/// Each state below carries data or an external relationship that lives OUTSIDE the schema package, so a
/// copy-and-swap destroys it silently and no re-deploy can put it back. Getting the ANSWER right is only
/// half of it -- the operator has to be told WHICH state blocked them, or they cannot decide what to write
/// instead. Every assertion here therefore pins the named state, not merely "something was returned".
///
/// This fixture runs in its own database. Change Data Capture and Change Tracking are DATABASE-scoped
/// switches, and sp_cdc_enable_table writes database-wide replication metadata; turning either on inside the
/// shared integration database would leak into every sibling fixture and (per
/// SchemaQuench.IntegrationTests.SqlServer.TableQuench_CDCTests) invites cross-fixture deadlocks.
///
/// NOT covered here: sys.tables.is_replicated. Marking a table as a replication article needs a configured
/// distributor and a running SQL Server Agent, neither of which exists in the Linux CI container, and the
/// undocumented sp_MS* shortcuts that fake the flag are not a state a user can reach. The predicate is in
/// the function; this suite does not prove it fires.
