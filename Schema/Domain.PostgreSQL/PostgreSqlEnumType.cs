    /// <para><b>What can and cannot converge is the engine's limit, not a choice.</b> PostgreSQL can ADD a
    /// value (and place it, via <c>BEFORE</c>/<c>AFTER</c>), but it cannot remove or reorder one without
    /// dropping and recreating the type — which means dropping every column that uses it. So a value
    /// removed from the package is <i>reported</i>, never silently dropped, the same posture placement
    /// takes.</para>
