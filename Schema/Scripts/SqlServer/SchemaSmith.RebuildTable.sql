-- Replaces one table with a table built to the DECLARED definition, carrying its rows across:
-- refuse-if-blocked, capture the identity counter, drop inbound foreign keys, create a shadow, copy,
-- reseed, swap, drop the old one. Nothing in here decides WHEN a rebuild should happen -- the caller
-- decides that and calls this; the procedure is also directly callable, which is what makes it testable
-- before any decision path exists.
--
-- Deliberately NOT this procedure's job: indexes, primary keys, unique/check constraints, foreign keys
-- and named defaults. The old table is dropped whole, which takes all of them with it, and the ordinary
-- quench passes that follow re-add them from the same JSON that produced #Columns. Re-adding them here
-- would duplicate that logic against a second source of truth -- so the surface stays small on purpose,
-- and the one thing this procedure owns is the DATA.
--
-- Reads the declared definition from #Columns / #Tables, so it MUST be called after
-- ParseTableJsonIntoTempTables has run in the caller's scope -- the same contract every quench
-- procedure already has. Called with no parse in scope it refuses rather than reading a stale or absent
-- working set.
--
-- Everything destructive runs inside ONE transaction with XACT_ABORT ON. See the transaction comment
-- below for exactly what a mid-flight failure leaves behind.

  --   * computed / persisted -- the shadow derives them, and inserting into one is an error;
  --   * TIMESTAMP / ROWVERSION -- the engine owns the value ("Cannot insert an explicit value into a
  --     timestamp column"); the row version is per-row-version state, not user data;
  --   * a COLUMN_SET -- it aggregates the sparse columns that are ALSO in the list, and writing both the
  --     set and its members in one INSERT is rejected. Copying the sparse columns individually carries
  --     the same data.
  -- The insert list and the select list are ONE string by construction: same columns, same order, so
  -- they cannot drift apart into a positional mismatch that would write data into the wrong column.
