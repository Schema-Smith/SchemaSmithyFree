  -- THE REBUILD DECISION POINT.
  --
  -- WHY HERE. Column-change detection finished one statement above: #ColumnChanges holds every
  -- modification and every by-absence drop, and #SuppressedColumnDrops names the drops this run will NOT
  -- perform. And nothing has yet touched a table that is STILL DECLARED: everything executed above this
  -- line either turns off temporal tracking for a table no longer declared temporal or drops a table that
  -- left the product entirely. The very next EXEC -- the foreign-key capture and drop immediately below --
  -- is where this procedure starts dismantling the dependent objects OF a declared table, and a rebuild
  -- drops all of those wholesale anyway. A rebuild inheriting a half-dismantled table would have
  -- RebuildTable's pre-rebuild refusals reasoning about a live state that no longer matches the declared
  -- file, so "before the ALTER phases" is the wrong boundary and this one is the right one. Renames land
  -- earlier still, in MissingTableAndColumnQuench, which matters: RebuildTable refuses outright while a
  -- table or column rename is pending, because the copy matches columns by their CURRENT name.
  --
  -- OPT-IN BY CONSTRUCTION. #RebuildElection is built by a WHERE that only an explicit ALWAYS/THRESHOLD,
  -- or an explicit OnOrderMismatch, can satisfy. A package with no RebuildPolicy anywhere resolves to the
  -- domain object's NEVER default with OnOrderMismatch false
  -- at every level, elects nothing, and this whole block is a no-op: no rebuild, no statement, nothing
  -- added to the run. A rebuild moves user data, so a table that did not ask for one must never get one,
  -- and that has to be structurally true rather than true because the conditions happen not to match.
  --
  -- WHOLE-OBJECT RESOLUTION. [RebuildPolicySpecified] picks WHICH policy applies -- the table's own, or
  -- the resolved upper-tier one passed in -- and then every field comes from that ONE policy. Never a
  -- per-field COALESCE: a table declaring only { "Mode": "ALWAYS" } must not inherit a product's
  -- Threshold. Mirrors ProductQuench.ResolveCascadedPolicy, which collapses the three upper tiers the
  -- same way before this procedure is called.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -- COLUMN-ORDER DRIFT, the input to the OnOrderMismatch trigger.
  --
  -- Reordering existing columns is impossible in place on every engine SchemaSmith supports, so a rebuild
  -- is the only mechanism that can converge a table whose columns are in the wrong order. This pass names
  -- the tables where that is true.
  --
  -- DECLARED ORDER IS [_RowId], because that is what RebuildTable orders the shadow's CREATE by. Detection
  -- and repair MUST read the declared order off the same column: if this pass elected on one definition of
  -- "declared order" and the rebuild produced another, the table would be re-elected on every subsequent
  -- deploy and rebuilt forever -- which on this feature means copying every row of the table, every deploy.
  --
  -- THE COMPARISON IS RELATIVE, NEVER ABSOLUTE. #DeclaredColumnOrder pairs each column’s declared position
  -- with its live ORDINAL_POSITION, and the mismatch test below looks only for an INVERSION -- two columns
  -- whose declared order disagrees with their live order. Comparing the two positions for EQUALITY would be
  -- wrong, and the reason is engine-specific rather than universal (measured 2026-08-27):
  --   * PostgreSQL’s information_schema.ordinal_position is attnum and KEEPS the gap left by every column
  --     ever dropped. A correctly-ordered table that has ever lost a column would show declared 2 against
  --     live 3 and be rebuilt on every single deploy -- the infinite-rebuild trap, and on this feature that
  --     means moving every row of the table every time.
  --   * SQL Server’s INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ORDINAL_POSITION RENUMBERS, so the gap is invisible here. It is
  --     sys.columns.column_id that retains it -- which this query deliberately does not read.
  --   * MySQL renumbers contiguously and never exposes a gap either.
  -- An inversion test never reads a position’s value, only two positions’ order, so a uniform shift by any
  -- number of gaps is invisible to it on every engine and only genuine drift is detected. Writing it this
  -- way means the three engines need no per-engine branch.
  --
  -- THE COMPARED SET IS THE INTERSECTION, which the join produces by construction.
  --   * Declared AND live -- compared. This is the real question.
  --   * Live but NOT declared -- excluded, because it has no declared position to compare. These are the
  --     columns this run drops by absence (a table RETAINING one cannot reach the election at all: the
  --     #SuppressedColumnDrops guard below excludes it), so they will not exist after the run and must not
  --     drag a correctly-ordered table into a rebuild. Including them would re-elect any table with a
  --     retained column forever -- the same infinite loop from the other direction.
  --   * Declared but NOT live -- cannot occur here: MissingTableAndColumnQuench added it earlier in the
  --     same run, so by this line it is live and the join finds it. It needs no special case, and the
  --     comparison is simply over the live set. Note this makes a NEW column in a mid-file position a
  --     genuine mismatch, correctly: the ADD appended it to the end, and only a rebuild can move it.
