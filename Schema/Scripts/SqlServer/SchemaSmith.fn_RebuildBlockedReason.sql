-- Answers "why can this table NOT be rebuilt?" -- a short reason naming the blocking state, or NULL when a
-- rebuild is safe. A rebuild is a shadow-copy-and-swap, and each state below lives OUTSIDE the definition a
-- schema package carries, so the copy silently destroys it and the package cannot put it back: a temporal
-- table's history rows, a CDC capture instance and its change table, a replication article's identity, a
-- Change Tracking baseline. Fail closed and leave those tables to Before/After migration scripts.
--
-- A reason string rather than a bit so the caller can name the state instead of saying "cannot"; a function
-- rather than inline logic so each state is verifiable on its own.
--
-- Version gate. sys.tables.temporal_type_desc is SQL Server 2016 (13.x), and a function body is COMPILED at
-- CREATE -- so a static reference is an "invalid column" error at KINDLE time on an older server, failing the
-- whole helper deployment rather than one path at runtime. The temporal predicate is therefore assembled into
-- the CREATE text only when the target is 2016+; below that no table can be system-versioned, so omitting the
-- predicate is complete rather than a compromise. Both forms are built from one body string, so the signature
-- and the return contract cannot drift apart.
--
-- The gate reads SchemaSmith.fn_ServerMajorVersion() (kindled earlier in the list) rather than the raw
-- {{ServerMajorVersion}} token. The token bakes to 0 whenever the caller detected no version -- several
-- SchemaTongs kindle paths pass nothing -- and a literal "IF 0 >= 13" would build the degraded body on a
-- modern server. fn_ServerMajorVersion already resolves the baked token, the CONTEXT_INFO test override and
-- the SERVERPROPERTY fallback, in that order, and returns NULL (-> ELSE) on a genuine pre-2016 binary.
--
-- Referenced statically because both predate the SQL Server 2008 floor: sys.tables.is_replicated (present
-- since sys.tables itself, 2005) and sys.tables.is_tracked_by_cdc (present since CDC shipped in 2008) --
-- neither carries an "Applies to" version qualifier in the catalog reference, unlike temporal_type_desc.
-- SchemaSmith.GenerateTableXml.sql, the compat-100 path exercised against genuine old binaries, already reads
-- is_tracked_by_cdc statically, so that half of the claim is codebase-certified rather than only documented.
-- sys.change_tracking_tables shipped with Change Tracking in 2008 for the same reason.
