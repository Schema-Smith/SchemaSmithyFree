-- FILESTREAM columns, applied after the table's keys exist.
--
-- Its own procedure for the same reason SchemaSmith.ChangeTrackingQuench is: SQL Server refuses a
-- FILESTREAM column unless the table already carries a non-null ROWGUIDCOL column covered by a unique
-- CONSTRAINT (error 5505), and SchemaSmith creates columns in MissingTableAndColumnQuench but keys in
-- MissingIndexesAndConstraintsQuench -- after. A FILESTREAM column emitted with its table therefore
-- fails on every new table. MissingTableAndColumnQuench withholds them; this adds them once the keys
-- are in place.
--
-- Certified against a real instance, because the engine is stricter than error 5505 reads: a unique
-- INDEX does NOT satisfy it. Only a PRIMARY KEY or a UNIQUE constraint does. SchemaSmith already
-- distinguishes the two -- Indexes[].UniqueConstraint emits ADD CONSTRAINT ... UNIQUE, Unique emits an
-- index -- so the check below deliberately tests is_primary_key/is_unique_constraint and not is_unique.
