    -- Answers "why can this table NOT be rebuilt?" -- a short reason naming the blocking state, or NULL when
    -- a rebuild (shadow-copy-and-swap) is safe.
    --
    -- MySQL has almost none of the states a rebuild would silently destroy: no system-versioned tables, no
    -- application-time periods, no table-level Change Data Capture or Change Tracking, and its replication is
    -- statement/row streaming off the binlog rather than a per-table article whose identity a swap would
    -- break. Partitioning is the exception, and it is checked below.
    --
    -- DO NOT extend this by copying the MariaDb override's system-versioning or period checks
    -- (Scripts/MariaDb/SchemaSmith_RebuildBlockedReason.sql). MariaDB genuinely has both; MySQL does not, and
    -- its INFORMATION_SCHEMA has no PERIODS table -- referencing one is ER_UNKNOWN_TABLE (1109) at CREATE
    -- time, which would fail the entire kindle rather than one query. Same shape as SchemaSmith_ColumnSrid,
    -- where the engine that lacks the catalog object simply returns nothing.
    DECLARE v_Count INT DEFAULT 0;

    -- PARTITIONING IS THE ONE STATE THIS ENGINE DOES HAVE. A partition definition lives in the table DDL,
    -- not in a separate catalog object, so a shadow built from the package's column list is unpartitioned by
    -- construction: the swap keeps every row and drops the layout, with nothing to report it. PostgreSQL's
    -- twin of this function already refuses for the same reason.
    --
    -- A NON-partitioned table yields ONE row here with every partition column NULL rather than no rows at
    -- all, so the test is PARTITION_NAME IS NOT NULL. INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS predates the supported
    -- floor on both engines (verified on MySQL 5.7 and MariaDB 10.2), so it is read statically.
