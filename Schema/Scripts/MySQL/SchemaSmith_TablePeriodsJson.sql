READS SQL DATA
BEGIN
    -- The table's application-time periods as a JSON array, or '[]' when it has none.
    --
    -- Always '[]' on MySQL: application-time periods are a MariaDB feature and MySQL has no equivalent
    -- at any version.
    --
    -- WHY A SEPARATE FUNCTION rather than a read inlined into GenerateTableJson: the answer lives in
    -- INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PERIODS, and MySQL rejects a routine that references a table which does not
    -- exist -- at CREATE time, ERROR 1109, even inside a branch that can never run. TABLE resolution is
    -- not deferred the way COLUMN resolution is (contrast SchemaSmith_IsSystemTimePeriodColumn, which
    -- depends on exactly that deferral). A static reference in the shared caller would therefore have
    -- broken kindling for every MySQL target.
    --
    -- Parameters are accepted only to keep the signature identical to the MariaDb override.
