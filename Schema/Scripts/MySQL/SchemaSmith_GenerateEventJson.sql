BEGIN
    -- Extracts one scheduled event as the DECLARATIVE package form.
    --
    -- A kindled script rather than inline SQL in SchemaTongs, matching GenerateTableJson and
    -- GenerateMaterializedViewJson -- which also means the translation below can be certified against a
    -- live server instead of only exercised through the whole cast pipeline.
    --
    -- THE TRANSLATION IS THE POINT. The catalog reports these in a different vocabulary from the DDL an
    -- author writes, and the package uses the DDL spelling:
    --   STATUS        ENABLED / DISABLED / SLAVESIDE_DISABLED  ->  ENABLE / DISABLE / DISABLE ON SLAVE
    --   ON_COMPLETION 'PRESERVE' / 'NOT PRESERVE'              ->  a bool
    --   interval      INTERVAL_VALUE + INTERVAL_FIELD          ->  one string, "1 DAY"
    --   EVENT_TYPE    RECURRING / ONE TIME                     ->  EVERY / AT
    --
    -- STARTS IS DELIBERATELY NOT EMITTED. The server MATERIALISES it to the creation time when it was
    -- not specified, so capturing it would pin the event to whenever it happened to be created -- and
    -- every later deploy would then see drift, drop the event and recreate it, RESETTING ITS SCHEDULE
    -- each time. A nightly job would walk forward on every deploy and nothing would look wrong. An
    -- author who genuinely wants a fixed start writes Starts themselves.
