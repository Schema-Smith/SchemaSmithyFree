    -- system versioning at any version and therefore no such variable.

    -- WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE PROCEDURE rather than a branch inside ModifiedTableQuench: MySQL rejects a
    -- routine that so much as MENTIONS @@system_versioning_alter_history, at CREATE time, even inside a
    -- branch that can never run. Verified live on MySQL 8.0.45 -- a procedure whose only reference sits
    -- inside IF VERSION() LIKE '%MariaDB%' fails to create with
    --   ERROR 1193 (HY000): Unknown system variable 'system_versioning_alter_history'
    -- System-variable resolution is NOT deferred the way column resolution is (contrast
    -- SchemaSmith_IsSystemTimePeriodColumn, where a missing COLUMN is legal until the statement runs).
    -- So a version-gated branch in the shared file would have broken kindling for every MySQL target,
    -- and the divergence has to live in a per-file MariaDb override instead -- the same shape
    -- SchemaSmith_ColumnSrid uses, and the one the temporal spike predicted would be needed here.
