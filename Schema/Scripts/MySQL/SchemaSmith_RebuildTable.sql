-- Replaces one table with a table built to the DECLARED definition, carrying its rows across:
-- refuse-if-blocked, capture the AUTO_INCREMENT counter, create a shadow, copy, reseed, swap, drop the
-- inbound foreign keys, drop the old one. Nothing in here decides WHEN a rebuild should happen -- the
-- caller decides that and calls this; the procedure is also directly callable, which is what makes it
-- testable before any decision path exists.
--
-- Deliberately NOT this procedure's job: secondary indexes, unique/check constraints, foreign keys, and
-- the table attributes the convergence passes own (ROW_FORMAT, COMMENT, the declared AUTO_INCREMENT
-- seed). The old table is dropped whole, which takes all of them with it, and the ordinary quench passes
-- that follow re-add them from the same JSON that produced _SchemaSmith_Columns. Re-adding them here
-- would duplicate that logic against a second source of truth, so the surface stays small on purpose and
-- the one thing this procedure owns is the DATA.
--
-- The ONE exception, and it is engine-forced rather than chosen: the shadow's CREATE carries the declared
-- PRIMARY KEY, because MySQL and MariaDB refuse a CREATE TABLE whose AUTO_INCREMENT column is not part of
-- a key. The SQL Server and PostgreSQL twins have no such constraint and emit no key at all. See section
-- 6 for the full reasoning and why it is not a second source of truth.
--
-- Reads the declared definition from _SchemaSmith_Columns / _SchemaSmith_Tables, so it MUST be called
-- after SchemaSmith_ParseTableJson has run on the same CONNECTION -- the same contract every quench
-- procedure already has (MySQL TEMPORARY tables are session-scoped). Called with no parse in scope it
-- refuses rather than reading an absent working set. Those temp tables carry no schema column, because a
-- parse is per-DATABASE on MySQL, so p_Schema must name the database that parse ran for; that is a caller
-- contract this procedure has no way to verify.
--
-- On MySQL schema == database, so p_Schema IS the database name -- the same value the sibling quench
-- procedures take as p_DatabaseName -- and every identifier below is qualified `p_Schema`.`name`.
--
-- =====================================================================================================
-- ATOMICITY -- READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING THE ORDER OF ANYTHING BELOW.
--
-- MySQL and MariaDB DDL is NOT transactional. START TRANSACTION / ROLLBACK around a CREATE TABLE leaves
-- the table behind, and every DDL statement issues an implicit COMMIT that also releases any row locks
-- taken before it. The single-transaction protection the SQL Server and PostgreSQL twins rely on -- a
-- mid-failure leaving the original untouched under its own name -- DOES NOT EXIST HERE, and this file
-- deliberately does not open a transaction and call it a rollback guarantee. A reader arriving from
-- either of those engines must not assume a rollback they are not getting.
--
-- Two things make the operation workable instead, and the step order is built on both:
--
--   1. THE SWAP IS ATOMIC IN ONE STATEMENT. RENAME TABLE t TO t_old, t_shadow TO t swaps both names
--      atomically, so there is never an instant where the application's table name resolves to nothing --
--      which is precisely the window the other engines' transaction exists to close.
--
--   2. BECAUSE THE SWAP IS ATOMIC, THE DESTRUCTIVE STEP MOVES AFTER IT. On SQL Server and PostgreSQL the
--      inbound foreign keys must come out BEFORE the swap because the rename is not atomic with anything.
--      Here the reversible work goes first, so the irreversible part is as short as possible.
--
-- WHAT A MID-FAILURE LEAVES BEHIND, STEP BY STEP -- said out loud precisely because the other two
-- engines do give a rollback and this one cannot:
--
--   Step 1 (create shadow / copy / reseed) -- FULLY REVERSIBLE. A failure strands the shadow table and
--     nothing else. The original is untouched under its own name with all of its rows, its inbound
--     foreign keys, its indexes and its constraints. The stranded shadow is NOT auto-dropped: the
--     shadow/old name-collision refusal below catches it on the next run and makes a human look at it,
--     which is the same judgement the collision refusal already makes about any leftover.
--
--   Step 2 (RENAME TABLE t TO t_old, t_shadow TO t) -- ATOMIC. It either happens or it does not.
--
--   Step 3 (drop the inbound foreign keys, then DROP TABLE t_old) -- a failure here leaves the LIVE table
--     already correct and complete under its own name with all of the data, plus a parked t_old holding
--     the pre-rebuild rows. No data is lost either way; the operator drops t_old once satisfied.
--
--   Referential integrity is missing only between step 3 and the foreign-key quench pass that re-creates
--     the inbound keys from the CHILD tables' own JSON. On the other two engines that gap spans the whole
--     copy; here it spans two statements.
--
-- WHAT THIS CANNOT PROTECT AGAINST, stated rather than papered over: because every DDL statement commits
-- implicitly, no lock can be held from the copy through to the swap, and LOCK TABLES is unusable inside a
-- stored procedure (it would also make every other table -- the shadow, the working set, the audit --
-- unreachable for the rest of the run). A row inserted by another session after the copy scan and before
-- the swap is therefore copied nowhere and dropped with t_old. The row-count check immediately before the
-- swap DETECTS the common case and aborts loudly rather than losing it silently, but detection is not
-- prevention: a rebuild wants a quiesced target on this engine in a way it does not on the other two.

    -- from both siblings and is worth stating because the three engines genuinely disagree: SQL Server's
    -- IDENT_CURRENT is the LAST value issued (so 3a's reseed lands one below MySQL's number for the same
    -- table), and PostgreSQL's sequence last_value is likewise the last value written. MySQL's is already
    -- the next value, so it is applied verbatim -- no +1, no -1.
    --
    -- It must be the ORIGINAL's counter, never max(id) on the copied rows. Proven: with ids 1-3 and id 3
    -- deleted, the counter reads 4 while the copied max is 2, so reseeding from the data re-issues 3 -- an
    -- identifier the old table had already given to a row that existed. Anything that recorded the old 3
    -- then aliases two different entities, and nothing errors. (InnoDB also clamps ALTER TABLE
    -- AUTO_INCREMENT UPWARD to max+1, so a too-low value is silently accepted as exactly that defect.)
    --
    -- A NULL capture means one of two things and both want the same answer: the table has no
    -- AUTO_INCREMENT column at all, or it has one that has never issued a value (InnoDB reports NULL for
    -- a table that has never held a row -- the same case ModifiedTableQuench's seed pass COALESCEs to 0).
    -- Either way the reseed is skipped and the shadow keeps whatever counter it built itself, which is
    -- exactly what the SQL Server twin does when sys.identity_columns.last_value is NULL: forcing a
    -- never-used counter would burn its start value for no reason.

    -- information_schema_stats_expiry does not exist on MySQL 5.7 or on MariaDB at any version: naming it
    -- in the procedure body would risk the CREATE, and referencing it dynamically keeps the parser away

    -- deferred: MySQL and MariaDB both accept a GENERATED ALWAYS AS (...) expression that references a
    -- column declared LATER in the same CREATE TABLE, verified on both, so declared order is honoured
    -- literally with no follow-up ALTER. (ParseTableJson's DependencyLevel exists for the ADD COLUMN path,
    -- where the referenced column may not exist in the table yet.)
    --
    -- Including them is not optional, either. MissingTableAndColumnQuench adds a generated column only
    -- where NewColumn = 1, and NewColumn was decided at parse time against the PRE-rebuild table, where
    -- the column existed -- so a generated column left out of this CREATE would be dropped by the rebuild
    -- and never put back by anything.
    --
    -- The COPY moves only the INTERSECTION of declared and live, which is what makes the three cases fall
    -- out without special-casing: a column declared but not live is new (it takes its DEFAULT or NULL and
    -- must not appear in the SELECT), a column live but not declared is being removed (it appears in
    -- neither list), and a column on both sides carries its data.
    --
    -- Generated columns are excluded from the copy on the DECLARED side only, because the SHADOW derives
    -- them and INSERT cannot target a generated column at all. Declared-side only is deliberate: the live
    -- table is only ever READ from, and a live generated column the package now declares plain is
    -- perfectly selectable -- carrying its computed values across is the right answer, and testing the
    -- live side would lose them silently. Nothing else needs excluding here: unlike SQL Server there is no
    -- ROWVERSION and no column set, an AUTO_INCREMENT column accepts an explicit value with no session
    -- switch, and an INVISIBLE column is invisible only to SELECT *, which this never emits.
    --
    -- A newly declared NOT NULL column with no DEFAULT on a non-empty table is NOT special-cased: the copy
    -- fails on the null violation and the original is untouched (see the step-1 note in the header).
    -- Failing loudly beats inventing a value.
