    -- MariaDb variant override of the shared MySQL function (which returns NULL unconditionally -- MySQL has
    -- none of these concepts). MariaDB does: a system-versioned table carries row history, and an
    -- application-time period carries a temporal contract, and neither survives a shadow-copy-and-swap
    -- rebuild or can be reconstructed from the schema package. Fail closed and leave those tables to
    -- Before/After migration scripts. See the MySQL base definition for the full rationale.
    DECLARE v_Count INT DEFAULT 0;

    -- MariaDB reports a system-versioned table as 'SYSTEM VERSIONED' rather than 'BASE TABLE' (the same
    -- divergence SchemaSmith_ParseTableJson's table-type filter accounts for). TABLE_TYPE itself is a
    -- standard INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES column, so this reads safely at the 10.2 floor -- the value simply
    -- never appears below 10.3, where system versioning arrived.

    -- INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PERIODS is MariaDB 11.4 -- the application-time period FEATURE arrived in 10.4.3,
    -- but the catalog table exposing it did not follow until 11.4. Unlike a missing COLUMN (deferred to
    -- execution, which is what lets SchemaSmith_IndexIsVisible / SchemaSmith_ColumnSrid guard with an early
    -- RETURN), a missing INFORMATION_SCHEMA TABLE is resolved by the PARSER: a static reference is
    -- ER_UNKNOWN_TABLE at CREATE time on 10.2 and 10.6 -- both supported, both in CI -- and would fail the
    -- whole kindle, not one query. A stored function cannot use PREPARE/EXECUTE to defer it either.
    --
    -- So the read is staged inside the MariaDB-only executable comment on the SET below: its six-digit
    -- version prefix (110400) makes the content compile on 11.4.0 and above and stay an inert comment below
    -- it, so the parser never sees PERIODS on a server that lacks the table. The staged text is an
    -- EXPRESSION fragment, not a statement, because statement delimiters are not permitted inside an
    -- executable comment -- hence a version-staged addend on a SET rather than a guarded IF block. Below
    -- 11.4 the SET leaves v_Count at 0 and no period is reported; that is a genuine detection gap on
    -- 10.4.3-11.3, where the state exists but nothing in the catalog can be asked about it.
    --
    -- SYSTEM_TIME is excluded so the reason names the state accurately: the system-versioning check above
    -- already owns that case and returns first.

    -- PARTITIONING IS THE ONE STATE THIS ENGINE DOES HAVE. A partition definition lives in the table DDL,
    -- not in a separate catalog object, so a shadow built from the package's column list is unpartitioned by
    -- construction: the swap keeps every row and drops the layout, with nothing to report it. PostgreSQL's
    -- twin of this function already refuses for the same reason.
    --
    -- A NON-partitioned table yields ONE row here with every partition column NULL rather than no rows at
    -- all, so the test is PARTITION_NAME IS NOT NULL. INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS predates the supported
    -- floor on both engines (verified on MySQL 5.7 and MariaDB 10.2), so it is read statically.
