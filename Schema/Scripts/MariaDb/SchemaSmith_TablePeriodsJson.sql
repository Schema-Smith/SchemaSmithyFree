    -- MariaDb variant override of the shared MySQL '[]' stub. See the MySQL base definition for why the
    -- read is isolated in a function at all.
    --
    -- TWO version thresholds, and they are not the same one -- this is the trap in the whole feature:
    --   * application-time periods themselves arrive in 10.4.3
    --   * INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PERIODS, the only catalog that reports them, arrives in 11.4
    -- So on 10.4.3 - 11.3 a period can exist on a table and nothing can be asked about it. This returns
    -- '[]' there, which is a genuine blind spot rather than an answer, and it is documented on
    -- MariaDbTable.Periods and in the reference so a user is not left to infer it from silence.
    --
    -- The read therefore sits inside a /*M!110400 ... */ version-prefixed executable comment: MariaDB
    -- runs the contents only from 11.4, and every earlier version -- including the 10.2 floor and the
    -- 10.6 leg CI runs -- sees a comment and leaves v_Json at its '[]' default. A plain runtime IF would
    -- not do: an unknown TABLE is rejected when the routine is CREATED, so the reference has to be
    -- invisible to the parser rather than merely unreached. SchemaSmith_RebuildBlockedReason uses the
    -- same construct for the same catalog and is the working precedent.
    --
    -- SYSTEM_TIME is excluded deliberately. MariaDB lists it in PERIODS alongside application periods on
    -- an explicitly-versioned table, but that state is already described by IsSystemVersioned and its
    -- columns are already excluded from extraction -- emitting it here as well would have a package
    -- declare the same thing twice, in two shapes that can then disagree.
