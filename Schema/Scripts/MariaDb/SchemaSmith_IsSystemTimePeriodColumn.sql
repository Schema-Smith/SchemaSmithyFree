    -- is isolated in a function at all rather than inlined into GenerateTableJson.

    -- Returns 1 for the row-start / row-end columns of a system-versioned table. Those columns are
    -- generated and maintained by the engine; SchemaSmith must not extract them as ordinary columns,
    -- because the apply path would then try to manage them and a re-deploy would attempt DDL the engine
    -- owns. SQL Server has the same exclusion for GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW START/END (#369).
    --
    -- Only the EXPLICIT authoring form exposes them. Verified live on 11.4.12:
    --   CREATE TABLE t (...) WITH SYSTEM VERSIONING                  -> row_start/row_end are HIDDEN,

    --                   PERIOD FOR SYSTEM_TIME(rs, re)) WITH SYSTEM VERSIONING

    -- So the implicit form needs no exclusion and this simply returns 0 for it.
    --
    -- Read GENERATION_EXPRESSION, not IS_SYSTEM_TIME_PERIOD_*. The latter looks like the obvious column
    -- and is a trap: it ships with INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PERIODS in 11.4, NOT with system versioning in
    -- 10.3. Measured against live servers -- absent on 10.2 AND 10.6, present on 11.4 -- after an
    -- asserted 10.3 guard cost every 10.3-11.3 target an 'Unknown column' failure.
    --
    -- GENERATION_EXPRESSION carries the literal 'ROW START' / 'ROW END' for an explicitly-declared
    -- period column and is present on every supported version, so this needs no version gate at all and
    -- leaves no read gap between 10.3 and 11.3. Verified identical on 10.6 and 11.4; on 10.2 the column
    -- exists and simply matches nothing, which is correct there -- 10.2 has no system versioning.
    --
    -- The implicit form (row_start/row_end hidden) is absent from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS entirely,
    -- so it needs no exclusion and this returns 0 for it either way.
