-- Replaces one table with a table built to the DECLARED definition, carrying its rows across:
-- refuse-if-blocked, capture the sequence position, drop inbound foreign keys, create a shadow, copy,
-- restore the sequence, swap, drop the old one. Nothing in here decides WHEN a rebuild should happen --
-- the caller decides that and calls this; the procedure is also directly callable, which is what makes it
-- testable before any decision path exists.
--
-- Deliberately NOT this procedure's job: indexes, primary keys, unique/exclude/check constraints, foreign
-- keys, and the table-level attributes (fillfactor, access method, LOGGED/UNLOGGED, row-level security).
-- The old table is dropped whole, which takes all of them with it, and the ordinary quench passes that
-- follow re-add them from the same JSON that produced temp_columns -- ModifiedTableQuench's table-attribute
-- pass converges persistence/access-method/RLS/fillfactor, MissingIndexesAndConstraintsQuench re-adds the
-- indexes and constraints, ForeignKeyQuench re-adds the keys. Re-adding any of it here would duplicate that
-- logic against a second source of truth, so the surface stays small on purpose and the one thing this
-- procedure owns is the DATA.
--
-- Reads the declared definition from temp_columns / temp_tables, so it MUST be called after
-- ParseTableJsonIntoTempTables has run in the caller's session -- the same contract every quench procedure
-- already has. Called with no parse in scope it refuses rather than reading a stale or absent working set.
--
-- ATOMICITY. There is no BEGIN/COMMIT in here and there deliberately cannot be: a plpgsql procedure runs
-- INSIDE the caller's transaction, so it has no transaction of its own to open. What provides the atomicity
-- is (a) PostgreSQL's transactional DDL, and (b) the fact that this procedure never catches an exception.
-- Every statement below -- the inbound-FK drops, the shadow CREATE, the copy, the swap, the DROP -- runs in
-- one transaction, and any failure at any point aborts that transaction whole. A mid-failure therefore
-- leaves the ORIGINAL table untouched under its own name, with all of its rows, its inbound foreign keys
-- still in place, and no shadow and no _SchemaSmithOld left behind. That is why there is no EXCEPTION block
-- here: an EXCEPTION handler opens a subtransaction and lets execution continue past a half-done rebuild,
-- which is precisely the state this procedure must never produce. If a future caller wraps this in an
-- explicit transaction block that also does other work, a failure here takes that work down too -- correct,
-- but called out so nobody discovers it.

  -- can be honoured literally with no follow-up ALTER.
  --
  -- The COPY moves only the INTERSECTION of declared and live, which is what makes the three cases fall out
  -- without special-casing: a column declared but not live is new (it takes its DEFAULT or NULL and must not
  -- appear in the SELECT), a column live but not declared is being removed (it appears in neither list), and
  -- a column on both sides carries its data.
  --
  -- Columns generated ON THE DECLARED SIDE are excluded from the copy, because the SHADOW derives them and
  -- INSERT cannot target a generated column at all. The exclusion is deliberately declared-side only: the
  -- live table is only ever READ from, and a live generated column the package now declares plain is
  -- perfectly selectable -- carrying its computed values across is the right answer, and excluding it on a
  -- live-side test would lose them silently.
  --
  -- A newly declared NOT NULL column with no DEFAULT on a non-empty table is NOT special-cased: the copy
  -- fails on the null violation, the transaction aborts, and the original table is untouched. Failing loudly
  -- beats inventing a value.
  --
  -- The insert list and the select list are ONE string by construction: same columns, same order, so they
  -- cannot drift apart into a positional mismatch that would write data into the wrong column.

  -- POSITION. pg_sequences.last_value is the last value the sequence WROTE, which is not the same as the
  -- largest value the table still holds. With ids 1-3 and id 3 deleted, last_value is 3 while max(id) is 2;
  -- restoring to the copied max makes the next insert re-issue 3, a value already given to a row that
  -- existed, and anything that recorded the old 3 then aliases two different entities. PostgreSQL is
  -- unforgiving about it in a useful way -- the shadow's sequence is NOT advanced by an explicit-value copy,
  -- so the naive path fails immediately with a duplicate key on id 1 rather than quietly re-issuing later --
  -- but it is wrong either way. So: capture first, setval to the capture, never to max(). last_value is NULL
  -- until the sequence has issued something, which distinguishes "never inserted" from "seeded at 1";
  -- forcing a never-used sequence would burn its start value for no reason, so that case is skipped.
  --
  -- NAME -- the PostgreSQL-only trap. An identity/serial column owns a NAMED sequence, and the sequence does
  -- NOT follow a table rename. Rebuild t through t_SchemaSmithRebuild and the surviving table ends up using
  -- t_SchemaSmithRebuild_id_seq. The data is correct, so a single functional test passes; the defect only
  -- shows up in a pg_dump or a puzzled \d, and it compounds across repeated rebuilds. The fix is in the
  -- DROP/RENAME script below and its ORDERING IS LOAD-BEARING: the old table still owns the natural sequence
  -- name until it is dropped, so the DROP must come first or the rename collides.
  --
  -- The names are derived with pg_get_serial_sequence rather than string-built, and resolved at RUN time
  -- inside the emitted statement, so the shadow's ACTUAL sequence is renamed even where PostgreSQL had to
  -- truncate or disambiguate the name it generated. pg_get_serial_sequence is called one column at a time in
  -- this loop rather than joined into the query: it ERRORS on a column that does not exist, and a planner
  -- free to evaluate it before the live-column join would hit exactly that.
  --
  -- KNOWN GAP, deliberate: a declared identity column that is NOT on the live table has no captured natural
  -- name to restore -- PostgreSQL names the shadow's new sequence after the shadow -- so its name is left
  -- alone rather than renamed to a string-built guess on a path that destroys data. It does not compound:
  -- the next rebuild captures that name as the natural one and restores it.
