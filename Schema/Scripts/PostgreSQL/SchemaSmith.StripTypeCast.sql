-- Strip trailing PostgreSQL type-cast suffix(es) from a stored/declared expression so column
-- defaults compare canonically. PostgreSQL stores a varchar/char default as "'value'::character
-- varying" (an explicit cast the catalog reports verbatim), while a hand-authored package declares
-- the bare "'value'". Without this, the two never compare equal and ModifiedTableQuench classes the
-- column as modified on every quench. Applied to BOTH sides of the default comparison so a
-- hand-authored ("'value'") and a SchemaTongs-extracted ("'value'::character varying") package both
-- converge to a no-op against the same catalog value. Only a TRAILING cast is removed (anchored at
-- end), so an embedded cast inside a function/expression default — e.g. nextval('seq'::regclass) —
-- is left intact.
