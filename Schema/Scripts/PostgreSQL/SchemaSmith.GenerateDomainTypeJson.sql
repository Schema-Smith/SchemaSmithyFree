  -- Extracts one domain type as the declarative package form.
  --
  -- format_type() RATHER THAN typname FOR THE BASE TYPE, because it renders the modifier too --
  -- "character varying(20)", "numeric(10,2)" -- and the modifier is part of the type. The quench compares
  -- the declared DataType against this same expression, so a round-tripped package compares equal instead
  -- of looking like a base-type change on every deploy.
  --
  -- contype = 'c' IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT TIDINESS, and it is a genuine version divergence rather than a
  -- theoretical one. PostgreSQL 17 reports a domain's NOT NULL as a pg_constraint row of its own
  -- (contype = 'n', named <domain>_not_null); PostgreSQL 12 -- the supported floor -- does not. Both were
  -- probed. Without the filter, a domain extracted on 17 would carry a phantom CHECK constraint holding
  -- the text "NOT NULL", which is not a valid predicate anywhere and which PostgreSQL 12 would have no
  -- way to produce. NOT NULL is read from pg_type.typnotnull instead, which both versions report the same.
  --
  -- Constraints are ordered BY NAME rather than by OID: OID order is creation order, which differs between
  -- two servers holding the same logical domain and would make an extraction diff noisy for no reason.
