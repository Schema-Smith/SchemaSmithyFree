    -- THE REBUILD DECISION POINT.
    --
    -- WHY HERE. temp_existing_columns -- the only live-column snapshot this procedure takes, and the
    -- thing every column pass below compares against -- was just built one statement above, so column
    -- detection is complete. And nothing has yet touched a table that is STILL DECLARED: the three
    -- ExecuteOrDebug calls above this line drop tables that left the product entirely (and their
    -- inbound keys). The first one that dismantles a dependent object OF a declared table is the
    -- foreign-key drop further down, and a rebuild drops all of those wholesale anyway; a rebuild
    -- inheriting a half-dismantled table would have RebuildTable's pre-rebuild refusals reasoning
    -- about a live state that no longer matches the declared file. Renames land earlier still, in
    -- MissingTableAndColumnQuench, which matters: RebuildTable refuses outright while a table or
    -- column rename is pending, because the copy matches columns by their CURRENT name.
    --
    -- Placing the decision even earlier than the remaining "Collect Existing ..." snapshots is
    -- deliberate on this engine: those snapshots are taken from the live catalog, so taking them AFTER
    -- the rebuild means the drop passes see the post-rebuild reality (indexes, constraints and keys
    -- already gone with the old table) instead of emitting drops for objects that no longer exist.
    --
    -- OPT-IN BY CONSTRUCTION. The election below is built by a WHERE that only an explicit
    -- ALWAYS/THRESHOLD can satisfy. A package with no RebuildPolicy anywhere resolves to the domain
    -- object's NEVER default at every level, matches nothing, and the loop body never runs: no rebuild,
    -- no statement, nothing added to the run. A rebuild moves user data, so a table that did not ask
    -- for one must never get one, and that has to be structurally true rather than true because the
    -- conditions happen not to match.
    --
    -- WHOLE-OBJECT RESOLUTION. "RebuildPolicySpecified" picks WHICH policy applies -- the table's own,
    -- or the resolved upper-tier one passed in -- and then every field comes from that ONE policy.
    -- Never a per-field COALESCE: a table declaring only { "Mode": "ALWAYS" } must not inherit a
    -- product's Threshold. Mirrors ProductQuench.ResolveCascadedPolicy.
