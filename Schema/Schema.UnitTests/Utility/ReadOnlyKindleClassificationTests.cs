/// The four outcomes for a read-only extraction target, tested where the decision lives rather than
/// through a database and a log appender.
/// <para>The split that matters is <b>NotKindled versus everything else</b>. Missing helpers is a hard
/// error because there is nothing to extract with, and proceeding would surface later as a confusing
/// "could not find stored procedure" — or produce nothing at all. Stale helpers only warn, because
/// refusing would make an Availability Group readable secondary useless the moment the primary is one
/// version ahead, which is most of the time.</para>
