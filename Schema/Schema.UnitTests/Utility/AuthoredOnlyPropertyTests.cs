/// <summary>
/// SchemaTongs overwrites a package in place, so anything extraction cannot reconstruct has to be carried
/// forward from the file being replaced. That carry-forward used to be a hand-written list, and eight
/// deploy-behaviour properties were missing from it — <c>UpdateFillFactor</c>, <c>SampleSize</c>, and the
/// whole <c>Drop*RemovedFromProduct</c> family — so authoring one and re-extracting silently reverted it,
/// leaving a package that is still perfectly valid and no longer does what its author asked.
///
/// These tests make the marking load-bearing: a table/component property must either be something an
/// extractor can produce, or be marked <c>AuthoredOnly</c> (which is what makes it copied). Adding a new
/// property that is neither fails the build here rather than going quiet until someone notices a deploy
/// behaving differently.
