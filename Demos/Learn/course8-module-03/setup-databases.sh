# Create the Course 8 Module 3 index/constraint/FK sandbox database on each sandbox
# engine, or on your own server's single activated engine (LEARN_SERVER): ONE EMPTY
# database diag_keys. No schema is seeded -- later tasks deploy a schema into it and break
# it on purpose. Re-running is safe -- creation is idempotent. PASS is reported only after
# the database is confirmed to exist (a create that silently fails reports FAIL, never a
# false PASS).
#
# --reset drops and recreates it empty. Use it to start the module's walkthrough over from
# a clean slate after it has broken the database on purpose. Only a database the labs
# created is ever dropped -- see lab_remove_db.
