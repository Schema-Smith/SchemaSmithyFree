# Course 8 · Module 5 — The recovery toolkit

Two induced incidents on one database (`diag_recovery`), recovered two different ways. Modules 1–4
were about **diagnosis** — locate the phase, read the artifact, name the failure. Module 4 recovered
everything with a plain redeploy. This module is the **recovery toolkit**: the three tools for the
situations a plain redeploy doesn't cover, and *when to reach for which*.

## Three tools for three situations

1. **Fix the source, re-run plain — the default.** A plain re-run discards any leftover checkpoint and
   starts fresh from the top. That's safe: every mechanical phase is idempotent, and an
   already-succeeded run-once script stays skipped via the `CompletedMigrationScripts` table. Most
   failures need nothing more.
2. **`--ResumeQuench` — opt in to *not* redo completed work.** Keeps the checkpoint, skips the phases
   and scripts that already finished, and resumes at the failure. Reach for it when re-running the
   completed work is expensive.
3. **Mark-done — bypass a script you handled by hand.** Tell SchemaSmith a run-once script is complete
   so it's never re-attempted. Reach for it when you fixed the underlying problem *outside* the package.

## Prerequisites

- The four-engine sandbox is up (`Demos/Learn/docker`) — see [`../README.md`](../README.md).
- `schemaquench --version` answers on your PATH. No from-source override — this module uses only
  long-shipped features (checkpointing, `--ResumeQuench`, `CompletedMigrationScripts`).

## Step 1 — create the sandbox database

**macOS / Linux:** `cd Demos/Learn/course8-module-05 && bash setup-databases.sh`
**Windows:** `cd Demos\Learn\course8-module-05 ; .\setup-databases.ps1`

Prints `PASS` per engine once `diag_recovery` exists.

## Step 2 — deploy the baseline (green)

```
cd sqlserver            # or postgres, mysql, or mariadb
schemaquench --ConfigFile:quench.settings.baseline.json --LogPath:"$PWD/logs"
```

Exits `0`, forges `Shop` into `diag_recovery`, and seeds three customers. Note the config sets
`CheckpointDirectory` to a lab-local `./checkpoints` — so when a deploy fails, you can open the
checkpoint file right here instead of digging in `%TEMP%`.

## Beat 1 — resume a half-finished deploy (`--ResumeQuench`)

`beat1-broken/` makes a real schema change (adds `IX_Customer_FullName`) and two run-once After-scripts:
`01_backfill_ok.sql` (succeeds) and `02_backfill_broken.sql` (an `INSERT` with a NULL `Email`, which is
NOT NULL). Deploy it:

```
schemaquench --ConfigFile:quench.settings.beat1-broken.json --LogPath:"$PWD/logs"
```

Exits `2` at the After slot: `Unable to quench '…02_backfill_broken.sql': …NULL…Email…` (`515` /
`23502` / `1048`). The index built, `01` ran, `02` failed — a **half-finished deploy**.

**Open the checkpoint** — `checkpoints/Shop.Main.<server>.diag_recovery..checkpoint`:

```ini
[Completed Steps]
ModifiedTables
IndexesAndConstraints
TableDataDelivery
ForeignKeys
...
[After Scripts]
./beat1-broken/Templates/Main/After Scripts/01_backfill_ok.sql
```

That's your map: four phases done, `01` done, `02` is where it stopped. Now watch the two re-runs.

**A plain re-run throws the map away.** Re-run *without* the flag (even before fixing `02`) and the log
re-runs every phase — `Quenching modified tables`, `…indexes and constraints`, `…foreign keys`,
`…after database scripts` — because `CleanupCheckpoints()` discarded the checkpoint. (`01` still skips,
via `Skipping (previously quenched)` — that's the `CompletedMigrationScripts` table, not the
checkpoint.) It starts over.

**`--ResumeQuench` picks up where it stopped.** Fix `02` (give it a real email), then:

```
schemaquench --ConfigFile:quench.settings.beat1-broken.json --LogPath:"$PWD/logs" --ResumeQuench
```

The log opens `Resuming from checkpoint (Completed Steps: 4, …)`, then jumps **straight to
`Quenching after database scripts`** — the four completed phases are skipped. Exit `0`, checkpoint
deleted. One gotcha you'll see: `Kindling the forge` still runs. Kindling and the missing-tables step
are **never** checkpointed — they rebuild session state the later phases need, so resume always re-runs
them. "Resume" skips the *phases*, not literally everything.

## Beat 2 — bypass a script you fixed by hand (mark-done)

`beat2-broken/` adds `03_seed_catalog_broken.sql` — a `Product` insert with a NULL `Sku`. Deploy it:
`01`/`02`/seed all `Skipping (previously quenched)`, and `03` fails (`Sku` NOT NULL: `515` / `23502` /
`1048`). This time you don't want to re-run the script — you'll seed the catalog correctly **by hand**
and tell SchemaSmith the script is done.

**1. Fix it by hand** (the real remediation, outside the package):

```sql
INSERT INTO Product (ProductId, Name, Sku, UnitPrice) VALUES (1, 'Anvil', 'ANV-001', 199.99);
```

**2. Mark the script done** — insert a row into `CompletedMigrationScripts` so it's never re-attempted.
The five-column key is the script's template-root-relative path, the product, the slot, the template,
and the schema:

```sql
-- SQL Server
INSERT SchemaSmith.CompletedMigrationScripts ([ScriptPath],[ProductName],[QuenchSlot],[template_name],[schema_name])
VALUES ('After Scripts/03_seed_catalog_broken.sql','Shop','After','Main','');

-- PostgreSQL  (the schema + table MUST be double-quoted — they're case-sensitive)
INSERT INTO "SchemaSmith"."CompletedMigrationScripts" ("ScriptPath","ProductName","QuenchSlot",template_name,schema_name)
VALUES ('After Scripts/03_seed_catalog_broken.sql','Shop','After','Main','');

-- MySQL / MariaDB
INSERT INTO SchemaSmith_CompletedMigrationScripts (ScriptPath,ProductName,QuenchSlot,template_name,schema_name)
VALUES ('After Scripts/03_seed_catalog_broken.sql','Shop','After','Main','');
```

**3. Re-run plain.** `03` now logs `Skipping (previously quenched)` and the deploy exits `0`. You bypassed
the broken script entirely — the catalog is seeded (your hand-fix), and SchemaSmith won't touch `03`
again.

## Which tool, when

- **Plain re-run** — the default. The failure was a script bug; fix it, re-run, done.
- **`--ResumeQuench`** — same fix, but you don't want to redo completed phases (a big deploy).
- **Mark-done** — you handled the problem another way and want the run-once script skipped for good.

One more lever: a script whose filename ends in `[ALWAYS]` runs every deploy and is never tracked (for
truly idempotent maintenance), and `TrackRunOnceMigrations: false` turns run-once tracking off entirely.

## What's next

- **Module 6 · Per-engine dialects & your runbook** — how the *same* failure reaches you differently on
  each engine, and assembling everything from this course into a team diagnostic runbook.
