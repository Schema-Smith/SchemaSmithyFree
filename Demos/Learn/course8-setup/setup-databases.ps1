# Create the Course 8 diagnostics baseline database on each sandbox engine, or on your own
# server's single activated engine (LEARN_SERVER): ONE EMPTY database diag_baseline. No
# schema is seeded -- the Module 1 deploy is what forges the Shop schema into the baseline.
# Re-running is safe -- creation is idempotent. PASS is reported only after the database is
# confirmed to exist (a create that silently fails reports FAIL, never a false PASS).
#
# -Reset drops and recreates it empty. Use it to return diag_baseline to a pristine state,
# for example after experimenting past Step 2 of this setup's walkthrough. Only a database
# the labs created is ever dropped -- see Remove-LabDatabase.
