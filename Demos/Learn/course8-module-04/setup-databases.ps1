# Create the Course 8 Module 4 script-slot + data-delivery sandbox database on each
# sandbox engine, or on your own server's single activated engine (LEARN_SERVER): ONE
# EMPTY database diag_scripts. No schema is seeded -- later tasks deploy a schema into it
# and break it on purpose. Re-running is safe -- creation is idempotent. PASS is reported
# only after the database is confirmed to exist (a create that silently fails reports
# FAIL, never a false PASS).
#
# -Reset drops and recreates it empty. Use it to start the module's walkthrough over from
# a clean slate after it has broken the database on purpose. Only a database the labs
# created is ever dropped -- see Remove-LabDatabase.
