# Course 10 · Module 4 — The oldest tier

Module 3 gave you two shapes of one query and a gate to pick between them. This module goes
all the way down to the **oldest tier in the fleet** — a SQL Server database so far back that
`OPENJSON` won't even parse — and shows what SchemaSmith does about it automatically, and
where the one real choice lands in **your** hands.

Two moving parts, and it's worth keeping them straight:

1. **The engine's own model ingest switches encoding by itself.** SchemaSmith's built-in
   `SchemaSmith.TableQuench` reads a serialized model payload to deploy your tables. On a modern
   tier it reads that payload as JSON (`OPENJSON`); below SQL Server database compatibility level
   130 it reads the **same** payload as XML, because `OPENJSON` parse-errors down there. Same
   proc name, same package, no flag — the engine swaps the body at kindle time. You never see it.
   The knob that governs it, `Target:CompatEncoding` (`auto｜legacy｜modern`, default `auto`),
   is SQL-Server-only and almost never touched.

2. **When you shred a model-payload token in your *own* SQL, the choice is yours.** The
   `{{TableSchema}}`-family tokens each ship an always-present **XML twin** — `{{TableXml}}`,
   `{{IndexedViewXml}}`, `{{MaterializedViewXml}}`. A script that shreds `{{TableSchema}}` with
   `OPENJSON` works on the modern tier and parse-errors on the old one. So you pair two variants
   behind Module 3's folder gate: `OPENJSON` on `{{TableSchema}}` where `{{CompatibilityLevel}}
   >= 130`, `.nodes()`/`.value()` on `{{TableXml}}` where `< 130`. **That is Course 10's gating
   pattern, turned on the reader's own code.**

The cliff that matters here is **compat 130** — the level `OPENJSON` needs — not 160 (Module 3's
axis) and not the server binary. On this fleet: `learn_2022` (compat 160) and `learn_2016` (compat
130) both clear it and take the JSON shred; `learn_2008` (compat 100) does not and takes the XML
shred.

## Prerequisites

- The four-engine sandbox is up (`Demos/Learn/docker`).
- **Run [`course10-setup`](../course10-setup/README.md) first** so the mixed fleet is standing:
  the three SQL Server tiers (`learn_2022` / `learn_2016` / `learn_2008` on `localhost,11433`)
  and the floor engines from the `mixed-fleet` profile — PostgreSQL 12 (`15433`), MySQL 5.7
  (`13316`), MariaDB 10.2 (`13317`). This module deploys into those; it does not create them.
- `schemaquench --version` answers **2.4.0** or later (for the encoding switch and the XML twin
  tokens).

---

## Part A — deploy the package (the engine's encoding switch is invisible)

The `sqlserver/package` declares two tables — `dbo.Widget` (a model worth serializing) and
`dbo.TableCatalog` (an audit table Part B fills). Deploying it to any tier looks identical from
the outside. The `learn_2008` deploy reads its model payload as XML internally; the `learn_2022`
deploy reads it as JSON — and nothing in the log or the result tells you which, because it does
not matter. The tables land the same way on both.

```
cd sqlserver
schemaquench --ConfigFile:quench.settings.2022.json --LogPath:"$PWD/logs"     # macOS / Linux
schemaquench --ConfigFile:quench.settings.2022.json --LogPath:"$PWD\logs"     # Windows
```

```
[localhost,11433].[learn_2022]   Skipping folder 'Shred/Legacy' — ShouldApplyExpression evaluated false
[localhost,11433].[learn_2022]     Quenching Shred/Modern\PopulateTableCatalog [ALWAYS].sql
[localhost,11433].[learn_2022] Successfully Quenched
```

That the same package deploys clean to `learn_2008` at compat 100 — where the engine quietly
used XML ingest — is the point. You'll see that deploy in Part C.

---

## Part B — the choice that IS yours: shredding the model your own way

The package's `Shred/Modern` and `Shred/Legacy` folders are a matched pair, folder-gated on
`{{CompatibilityLevel}}`. Each runs an `After` script that shreds the deployed model and writes
one row per column into `dbo.TableCatalog`, tagging the `Encoding` it used — so the audit table
itself proves which variant fired.

**Modern** (`ShouldApplyExpression: {{CompatibilityLevel}} >= 130`) shreds the JSON token:

```sql
DECLARE @model NVARCHAR(MAX) = N'{{TableSchema}}';   -- resolves to a JSON array [{...},{...}]
INSERT INTO dbo.TableCatalog (TableName, ColumnName, IsNullable, Encoding)
SELECT tbl.[Name], col.[ColumnName], col.[IsNullable], N'JSON (OPENJSON)'
FROM OPENJSON(@model) WITH ([Name] NVARCHAR(128) '$.Name', [Columns] NVARCHAR(MAX) '$.Columns' AS JSON) AS tbl
CROSS APPLY OPENJSON(tbl.[Columns]) WITH ([ColumnName] NVARCHAR(128) '$.Name', [IsNullable] BIT '$.Nullable') AS col;
```

**Legacy** (`ShouldApplyExpression: {{CompatibilityLevel}} < 130`) shreds the XML twin:

```sql
DECLARE @model xml = N'{{TableXml}}';                -- resolves to <Tables><Table>...</Table></Tables>
INSERT INTO dbo.TableCatalog (TableName, ColumnName, IsNullable, Encoding)
SELECT t.n.value('(Name/text())[1]', 'nvarchar(128)'),
       c.col.value('(Name/text())[1]', 'nvarchar(128)'),
       CONVERT(BIT, CASE LOWER(c.col.value('(Nullable/text())[1]', 'varchar(8)')) WHEN 'true' THEN 1 WHEN 'false' THEN 0 END),
       N'XML (.nodes/.value)'
FROM @model.nodes('/Tables/Table') AS t(n)
CROSS APPLY t.n.nodes('Columns') AS c(col);
```

### `learn_2022` (compat 160) ran the Modern shred

The deploy in Part A already ran the `After` scripts. `Shred/Modern` applied; `Shred/Legacy` was
skipped. Read the catalog back:

```
sqlcmd -S localhost,11433 -U sa -P "Learn!Passw0rd" -C -d learn_2022 -Q "SELECT TableName, ColumnName, IsNullable, Encoding FROM dbo.TableCatalog ORDER BY TableName, CatalogId;"
```

```
TableName     ColumnName   IsNullable  Encoding
------------  -----------  ----------  ---------------
Widget        WidgetId     0           JSON (OPENJSON)
Widget        Name         0           JSON (OPENJSON)
Widget        IsActive     1           JSON (OPENJSON)
Widget        Notes        1           JSON (OPENJSON)
TableCatalog  CatalogId    0           JSON (OPENJSON)
TableCatalog  TableName    0           JSON (OPENJSON)
TableCatalog  ColumnName   0           JSON (OPENJSON)
TableCatalog  IsNullable   1           JSON (OPENJSON)
TableCatalog  Encoding     0           JSON (OPENJSON)
```

### `learn_2008` (compat 100) ran the Legacy shred

Deploy to the oldest tier. `OPENJSON` would parse-error here, so `Shred/Modern` is gated off and
`Shred/Legacy` shreds the XML twin instead:

```
schemaquench --ConfigFile:quench.settings.2008.json --LogPath:"$PWD/logs"
sqlcmd -S localhost,11433 -U sa -P "Learn!Passw0rd" -C -d learn_2008 -Q "SELECT TableName, ColumnName, IsNullable, Encoding FROM dbo.TableCatalog ORDER BY TableName, CatalogId;"
```

```
[localhost,11433].[learn_2008]   Skipping folder 'Shred/Modern' — ShouldApplyExpression evaluated false
[localhost,11433].[learn_2008]     Quenching Shred/Legacy\PopulateTableCatalog [ALWAYS].sql
[localhost,11433].[learn_2008] Successfully Quenched

TableName     ColumnName   IsNullable  Encoding
------------  -----------  ----------  --------------------
Widget        WidgetId     0           XML (.nodes/.value)
Widget        Name         0           XML (.nodes/.value)
Widget        IsActive     1           XML (.nodes/.value)
Widget        Notes        1           XML (.nodes/.value)
TableCatalog  CatalogId    0           XML (.nodes/.value)
TableCatalog  TableName    0           XML (.nodes/.value)
TableCatalog  ColumnName   0           XML (.nodes/.value)
TableCatalog  IsNullable   1           XML (.nodes/.value)
TableCatalog  Encoding     0           XML (.nodes/.value)
```
Row-for-row identical to the compat-160 readback — only the `Encoding` tag differs.

Same rows, same `IsNullable` values — the two encodings carry the identical model. Only the
`Encoding` tag differs, proving which shred your gate fired on which tier.

> `learn_2016` sits at compat 130. Since `130 >= 130`, it takes the **Modern** shred exactly like
> `learn_2022` — the cliff is at 130, not 160. Deploy `quench.settings.2016.json` if you want to
> watch the boundary land on the JSON side.

### The footgun the XML path teaches

Look at the `IsNullable` conversion in the Legacy shred. In JSON, `Nullable` is a real boolean and
`OPENJSON ... WITH ([IsNullable] BIT '$.Nullable')` reads it straight into a `BIT`. In XML **every
scalar is text**, so the same flag arrives as the literal string `'true'`/`'false'`. A direct
`CAST('true' AS BIT)` errors:

```
Msg 245, Level 16, State 1
Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'true' to data type bit.
```

So the XML shred routes the flag through an explicit `CASE LOWER(...) WHEN 'true' THEN 1 WHEN
'false' THEN 0 END` before `CONVERT(BIT, ...)`. It's the same conversion SchemaSmith's own built-in
XML ingest uses. When you hand-write a legacy shred, this is the tax the text encoding charges.

---

## Part C — one package, every floor

The JSON-vs-XML *choice* is SQL-Server-only, but the promise that **one package deploys to the
floor of every engine** is not. Deploy the light single-table package to each engine's oldest
supported tier and watch them all take it — the encoding, wherever it applies, is automatic.

```
cd ../sqlserver && schemaquench --ConfigFile:quench.settings.2008.json --LogPath:"$PWD/logs"   # SQL Server compat 100
cd ../postgres  && schemaquench --ConfigFile:quench.settings.pg12.json  --LogPath:"$PWD/logs"   # PostgreSQL 12
cd ../mysql     && schemaquench --ConfigFile:quench.settings.json       --LogPath:"$PWD/logs"   # MySQL 5.7
cd ../mariadb   && schemaquench --ConfigFile:quench.settings.json       --LogPath:"$PWD/logs"   # MariaDB 10.2
```

```
[localhost,11433].[learn_2008] Successfully Quenched     # SQL Server 2008-floor (compat 100)
[localhost].[learn]            Successfully Quenched     # PostgreSQL 12 (15433)
[localhost].[learn]            Successfully Quenched     # MySQL 5.7 (13316)
[localhost].[learn]            Successfully Quenched     # MariaDB 10.2 (13317)
```

Why the choice doesn't travel: PostgreSQL has had JSON functions since 9.2, so its `{{TableSchema}}`
shreds at every supported version; MySQL and MariaDB below their JSON cliff fall back to
`JSON_EXTRACT` — still JSON. SQL Server is the only engine whose oldest tier can't parse JSON at
all, so it's the only one where the XML twin is a *needed* alternative rather than a portability
convenience. **This is not a parity gap** — it's an accurate reflection of where the encoding cliff
actually exists.

---

## An honest footnote on the legacy round-trip

The XML twin carries the structured model faithfully — schemas, tables, columns, indexes, all of
it. What it does **not** preserve through a SchemaTongs re-extract on the legacy tier is the
free-form `Extensions` bag (arbitrary author-supplied metadata). So don't over-claim a byte-perfect
round-trip on the oldest tier: the schema comes back whole; loose `Extensions` metadata may not.

## What's in here

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `sqlserver/package/Templates/Main/Tables/dbo.Widget.json` | A table with a model worth serializing — mixed nullability, a `BIT` column. |
| `sqlserver/package/Templates/Main/Tables/dbo.TableCatalog.json` | Audit table the shred fills — one row per shredded column, tagged with the `Encoding` used. |
| `sqlserver/package/Templates/Main/Shred/Modern/PopulateTableCatalog [ALWAYS].sql` | `OPENJSON` on `{{TableSchema}}`, folder-gated `{{CompatibilityLevel}} >= 130`. |
| `sqlserver/package/Templates/Main/Shred/Legacy/PopulateTableCatalog [ALWAYS].sql` | `.nodes()`/`.value()` on `{{TableXml}}`, folder-gated `{{CompatibilityLevel}} < 130`. |
| `sqlserver/quench.settings.2022.json` / `…2016.json` / `…2008.json` | Same package to each SQL Server tier (compat 160 / 130 / 100). |
| `postgres/` · `mysql/` · `mariadb/` | Light single-table packages for the "one package, every floor" beat (PG 12 / MySQL 5.7 / MariaDB 10.2). |

## Up next

Module 5 — **retiring the gates.** The oldest tier finally upgrades. Now the gates you built
across this course are debt with a payoff date: you delete the legacy variants, raise
`MinimumVersion` so pre-flight refuses the tier you stopped writing for, and the whole scheme
retires itself — which is exactly what made it a good pattern in the first place.
