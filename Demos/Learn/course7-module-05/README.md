# Course 7, Module 5 — Diagnosing a fleet failure (lab)

Goal: roll out a new unique index across the whole fleet, watch **two** tenants fail in **two different
phases**, and work through the exact sequence a real operator uses to locate each tenant's evidence, name its
phase, remediate it, and resume the run. You'll do all of this on SQL Server, then repeat the same moves on
PostgreSQL and MySQL.

This is the diagnostic capstone of Course 7. Do Modules 1–4 first — you already know how to build the
fleet, tune it, handle drift, and resume a partial failure. M5 is the middle step those modules skipped:
*what do you actually look at when more than one tenant fails in different ways?*

## Before you start

- The [sandbox](../docker) is up and verified (all three engines healthy).
- The fleet exists — run [`../course7-setup`](../course7-setup) once if you haven't already.
- The CLI is on your PATH — `schemaquench --version` answers **2.2.0** or later.

Each engine folder ships a `baseline/` package (the established fleet state), an `after/` package (adds the
`UQ_Customer_Email` unique index to `Customer`), two settings files, and drift + reset helpers for the two
failing tenants.

| File | What it's for |
| --- | --- |
| `baseline/` | The established Shop package — no `UQ_Customer_Email` yet. |
| `after/` | The rollout package — adds `UQ_Customer_Email` to `Customer.Email`. |
| `quench.settings.baseline.json` | Fleet run against `baseline/`. |
| `quench.settings.after.json` | Fleet run against `after/` (wires `ArtifactPath` and `CheckpointDirectory`). |
| `drift-tenant-002.sql` | Plants duplicate emails in `fleet_tenant_002` so the unique index fails to build. |
| `reset-tenant-002.sql` | Fixes the duplicate so the index can succeed on resume. |
| `drift-tenant-004.sql` | Drops `FK_OrderItem_Product` and inserts an orphan row in `fleet_tenant_004`. |
| `reset-tenant-004.sql` | Removes the orphan so the FK re-add succeeds on resume. |

## Step 1: Deploy the baseline

Land the `baseline/` package fleet-wide so every tenant starts at the same known state before the rollout:

```bash
cd sqlserver
schemaquench --ConfigFile:quench.settings.baseline.json
```

All five tenants deploy cleanly. Exit code `0`. Keep this as your clean starting point — you'll return to it
via the reset scripts in Step 5.

## Step 2: Stage the drift

Real fleet failures come from tenants that changed between your last deploy and this one. Simulate both
failure modes before the rollout:

**Stage the index failure on tenant 002** (duplicate emails):

```bash
docker exec -i learn-sqlserver /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P 'Learn!Passw0rd' -C \
  -i /dev/stdin < drift-tenant-002.sql
```

**Stage the FK failure on tenant 004** (dropped FK + orphan row):

```bash
docker exec -i learn-sqlserver /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P 'Learn!Passw0rd' -C \
  -i /dev/stdin < drift-tenant-004.sql
```

Look at the comments at the top of each drift file — they describe exactly what broke and why the rollout
will trip over it. Reading the drift script is the first diagnostic move: it shows you the *intent* of the
damage, which the engine's error will confirm.

## Step 3: Run the rollout — watch it fail

Deploy the `after/` package fleet-wide. The settings file already wires `ArtifactPath` and
`CheckpointDirectory` — you don't need to pass those flags:

```bash
schemaquench --ConfigFile:quench.settings.after.json
```

The run finishes with exit code `2`. Tenants 001, 003, and 005 succeed. Two fail:

```
[localhost,11433].[fleet_tenant_002] FAILED to quench:
The CREATE UNIQUE INDEX statement terminated because a duplicate key was found for the object name 'dbo.Customer' and the index name 'UQ_Customer_Email'. The duplicate key value is (dupe@shop.example).
[localhost,11433].[fleet_tenant_004] FAILED to quench:
The ALTER TABLE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint "FK_OrderItem_Product". The conflict occurred in database "fleet_tenant_004", table "dbo.Product", column 'ProductId'.
Template 'Main' had 2 failed work unit(s)
One or more database quenches FAILED
```

Two failures, two different engine errors — and they happened in two different phases of the convergence
pipeline. The failure count tells you how many; the error text names the phase.

## Step 4: Locate what failed and where

This is the diagnostic work. Three surfaces to read together:

**a) The `FAILED to quench:` blocks**

The log lines above are all you need to name the phase:

- `002`: `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` terminated on a duplicate key — the index build failed. This is the
  **index phase** (`Quench Indexes`). Error 1505 (SQL Server dup-key on index create).
- `004`: `ALTER TABLE` conflicted with a `FOREIGN KEY` constraint — a foreign key re-add tripped on an
  orphan row. This is the **FK phase** (`Quench Foreign Keys`). Error 547 (SQL Server FK conflict).

Notice: 004's FK was not in the `after/` change. The convergence engine re-checks the whole model on every
run; it found `FK_OrderItem_Product` missing, recreated it WITH CHECK, and the orphan failed it. The rollout
didn't cause the drift — it exposed it.

**b) The checkpoint files**

After a partial-failure run, **all five tenants** keep a checkpoint file — the checkpoint directory is not a
"failed tenants" manifest. The diagnostic signal is `[Completed Steps]`:

- `001`, `003`, `005` (succeeded): four mechanical steps recorded — `ModifiedTables`, `IndexesAndConstraints`,
  `TableDataDelivery`, `ForeignKeys`
- `002` (stopped at indexes): `[Completed Steps]` lists only `ModifiedTables`
- `004` (stopped at FK): `[Completed Steps]` lists `ModifiedTables`, `IndexesAndConstraints`,
  `TableDataDelivery`

Read the checkpoint alongside the error: 002's one completed step tells you exactly what the engine
*finished* before the failure. The unfinished phase is the next one — indexes. 004's three steps confirm it
got all the way through index creation before the FK phase terminated it.

**c) The resolved-SQL artifacts**

The `./artifacts` folder holds thin, copy-runnable `EXEC` wrappers — one per phase per tenant — named
`<server>.<database>.sql`. For example:

```
SchemaQuench - Quench Indexes localhost,11433.fleet_tenant_002.sql
SchemaQuench - Quench Foreign Keys localhost,11433.fleet_tenant_004.sql
```

These let you run the exact SQL the engine would execute — useful when you want to test the fix before
resuming. The engine error is in the **log**, not in the artifact; the artifact is the runnable command.
Notice that `002` has no `Quench Foreign Keys` artifact — the run stopped before it reached that phase.

> per-phase diagnostic method in depth — how to read the artifact, map the log error to the right table, and
> trace an orphan. M5 teaches the fleet overlay: locating which tenants failed and at which phase. Use both
> together on a real incident.

## Step 5: Remediate and resume

Fix each drifted tenant, then resume the run. Resume replays only the tenants that didn't finish — the ones
that succeeded skip past all their already-completed steps instantly.

**Fix tenant 002** (deduplicate the emails):

```bash
docker exec -i learn-sqlserver /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P 'Learn!Passw0rd' -C \
  -i /dev/stdin < reset-tenant-002.sql
```

**Fix tenant 004** (remove the orphan):

```bash
docker exec -i learn-sqlserver /opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U sa -P 'Learn!Passw0rd' -C \
  -i /dev/stdin < reset-tenant-004.sql
```

**Resume the run:**

```bash
schemaquench --ConfigFile:quench.settings.after.json --ResumeQuench
```

```
[fleet_tenant_001] Resuming from checkpoint (Completed Steps: 4, Completed Scripts: 0)
[fleet_tenant_003] Resuming from checkpoint (Completed Steps: 4, Completed Scripts: 0)
[fleet_tenant_005] Resuming from checkpoint (Completed Steps: 4, Completed Scripts: 0)
[fleet_tenant_004] Resuming from checkpoint (Completed Steps: 3, Completed Scripts: 0)
[fleet_tenant_002] Resuming from checkpoint (Completed Steps: 1, Completed Scripts: 0)
```

All five report `Successfully Quenched`. Exit code `0`. The checkpoint files are cleared — the run finished
clean.

Read the step counts: 001/003/005 are at 4 — all steps already done, they do no real work. 004 restarts
from step 4 (FK phase only). 002 restarts from step 2 (indexes onward). The checkpoint is the engine's
memory of exactly how far it got, so resume is surgical: you redeploy *only what didn't finish*.

## Step 6: Do it on PostgreSQL and MySQL

Same six moves in `postgres/` and `mysql/`. The fleet behavior is identical — two tenants fail, exit `2`,
resume exits `0`. Only the error text changes:

| Failure | SQL Server | PostgreSQL | MySQL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Index phase (002) | `The CREATE UNIQUE INDEX statement terminated because a duplicate key was found for the object name 'dbo.Customer' and the index name 'UQ_Customer_Email'. The duplicate key value is (dupe@shop.example).` | `23505: could not create unique index "uq_customer_email"` | `Duplicate entry 'dupe@shop.example' for key 'Customer.UQ_Customer_Email'` |
| FK phase (004) | `The ALTER TABLE statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint "FK_OrderItem_Product". The conflict occurred in database "fleet_tenant_004", table "dbo.Product", column 'ProductId'.` | `23503: insert or update on table "orderitem" violates foreign key constraint "fk_orderitem_product"` | `Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails` |

**Stage drift on PostgreSQL:**

```bash
docker exec -i learn-postgres psql -U postgres -d fleet_tenant_002 < postgres/drift-tenant-002.sql
docker exec -i learn-postgres psql -U postgres -d fleet_tenant_004 < postgres/drift-tenant-004.sql
```

**Stage drift on MySQL:**

```bash
docker exec -i learn-mysql mysql -uroot -pLearn!Passw0rd < mysql/drift-tenant-002.sql
docker exec -i learn-mysql mysql -uroot -pLearn!Passw0rd < mysql/drift-tenant-004.sql
```

Run, diagnose, reset, and resume from each engine's folder. The checkpoint `[Completed Steps]` counts and
the artifact naming pattern are the same across all three engines — only the error surface differs (on
PostgreSQL, detail lands in `ProgressLog`; on MySQL, it surfaces via the `SchemaSmith_StatusMessages` sidecar
and `ProgressLog` FAILED block — `Errors.log` is empty on both non-SS engines).

## Cleanup

The reset scripts return both tenants to a clean, deployable state. A successful resume deletes the
checkpoint files automatically; if you bailed out early, remove leftover directories:

```bash
rm -rf sqlserver/checkpoints sqlserver/artifacts
rm -rf postgres/checkpoints postgres/artifacts
rm -rf mysql/checkpoints mysql/artifacts
```

## The principle

One failure count can hide unrelated causes. `Template 'Main' had 2 failed work unit(s)` tells you *how
many* — not *why each one*, not *where each one stopped*. The diagnostic sequence is always the same: read
the `FAILED to quench:` block to name the phase, read the checkpoint to confirm how far the tenant got, and
look at the artifact to see the exact SQL the engine tried to run. Fix with intent — not just "it worked"
but "I know what broke, I removed the specific condition that caused it, and I confirmed the fix before
resuming." Then resume, and the engine handles the rest.

That's Course 7 complete. You can stand up a fleet, steer it, grow it, operate it safely when a tenant
drifts, and now diagnose it precisely when more than one tenant fails in different ways.
