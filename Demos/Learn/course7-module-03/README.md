# Course 7, Module 3 — Provisioning at onboarding (lab)

Goal: onboard a brand-new tenant in a **single deploy**. In Module 1 you ran `CREATE DATABASE` by hand
and let discovery find it. Here the config roster names a tenant that *doesn't exist yet* —
`fleet_tenant_006` — and `CreateIfMissing: true` makes SchemaSmith stand the database up itself, on the
admin connection, then forge the `Shop` schema into it. Safe by default, dry-runnable, idempotent, and
permission-gated. All four engines.

This builds on Module 2 — `CreateIfMissing` is a flag on the same `TemplateTargets` roster. Do Modules 1
and 2 first.

## Before you start

- The [sandbox](../docker) is up and verified (all four engines healthy).
- The fleet exists — run [`../course7-setup`](../course7-setup) once (creates `fleet_tenant_001`…`005`).
- `fleet_tenant_006` does **not** exist yet (that's the point). If a Module 1 run left it, drop it first.
- The CLI is on your PATH — `schemaquench --version` answers **2.4.0** or later.

Each engine folder ships the same native `Shop` `Package/` as Modules 1–2, plus three settings files —
all naming a roster of one existing tenant (`001`) and one that doesn't exist yet (`006`):

| Settings file | `CreateIfMissing` | `WhatIfONLY` | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `quench.settings.skip.json` | *(absent → false)* | false | Deploys `001`; **skips** the missing `006`. |
| `quench.settings.whatif.json` | true | true | Dry-run — shows what it *would* create. |
| `quench.settings.onboard.json` | true | false | Provisions `006` and forges `Shop` in. |

## Step 1: Safe by default — a missing tenant is skipped, not created

Point at the `skip` roster. `006` doesn't exist and `CreateIfMissing` is absent, so SchemaSmith leaves it
alone:

```bash
cd sqlserver
schemaquench --ConfigFile:quench.settings.skip.json
```

```
[localhost,11433] Database 'fleet_tenant_006' does not exist and TemplateTargets CreateIfMissing is false - skipping all iterations for this server-database pair.
```

`001` deploys; `006` is skipped with that line and **not created**. The default never conjures a database
you didn't ask for. (On PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB the line is identical but for the host prefix —
`[localhost]` without a port.)

## Step 2: Dry-run before you let it create anything

Turn `CreateIfMissing` on, but run under WhatIf first. SchemaSmith tells you exactly what it *would*
provision — and touches nothing:

```bash
schemaquench --ConfigFile:quench.settings.whatif.json
```

```
  [WhatIf] Would create database [fleet_tenant_006] (CreateIfMissing: true)
```

Check the catalog after — `006` still doesn't exist. That's your look-before-you-leap on provisioning.

## Step 3: Onboard — provision and deploy in one run

Now the real thing. `quench.settings.onboard.json` carries the roster plus `CreateIfMissing: true`:

```json
"TemplateTargets": {
  "Main": { "Databases": [ "fleet_tenant_001", "fleet_tenant_006" ], "CreateIfMissing": true }
}
```

```bash
schemaquench --ConfigFile:quench.settings.onboard.json
```

```
  Creating database [fleet_tenant_006] (CreateIfMissing: true)
```

SchemaSmith creates `fleet_tenant_006` on the admin connection, kindles the forge in it, and strikes the
whole `Shop` schema — four tables — into the fresh database. `001` is a no-op. Confirm:

```bash
cd ..            # back to the lab folder
../lab-sql.sh sqlserver fleet_tenant_006 "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sys.tables WHERE name IN ('Customer','Product','SalesOrder','OrderItem')"
# → 4
cd sqlserver     # back into the engine folder
```

Onboarding a tenant went from "run this DDL, then run the deploy" down to one deploy. Add the tenant to
the roster, quench, done.

## Step 4: Idempotent — re-run changes nothing

```bash
schemaquench --ConfigFile:quench.settings.onboard.json
```

No `Creating database` line this time — `006` already exists and is already in shape, so the whole roster
comes back a no-op alongside `001`. SchemaSmith's create is `IF NOT EXISTS` under the hood (a real
existence check on PostgreSQL), so a tenant that already exists is left exactly as-is. `CreateIfMissing`
is safe to leave on permanently — it only ever fills gaps.

## Step 5: Provisioning is a privileged act

Creating a database is a high-privilege operation, and SchemaSmith says so plainly when the deploy account
can't. Run the onboard as a principal that can *see* the fleet but lacks the create right, and the run
fails fast with an actionable message — it does not silently skip:

```
[localhost,11433] Database provisioning FAILED for 'fleet_tenant_006' (template 'Main'): Failed to provision database 'fleet_tenant_006'. The connecting account must have CREATE DATABASE permission on the admin database (master). Underlying error: CREATE DATABASE permission denied in database 'master'.
```

The account that onboards tenants needs the create right on the admin database. What that grant is called
differs by engine:

| Engine | Admin database | Required privilege | Underlying error you'll see |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SQL Server | `master` | `CREATE DATABASE` (or `dbcreator`) | `CREATE DATABASE permission denied in database 'master'` |
| PostgreSQL | `postgres` | `CREATEDB` | `42501: permission denied to create database` |
| MySQL | `information_schema` | `CREATE` | `Access denied … to database 'fleet_tenant_006'` |

> *MariaDB is a fourth platform in the MySQL family — its own `Platform: MariaDb` selection and native
> package, not the MySQL package retargeted. Its dialect matches MySQL except for a few DDL specifics
> (invisible indexes, check-constraint drops, column-default reporting) that SchemaSmith handles for
> you.*

The message shape is identical on all four engines — only the admin-database name and the underlying
error differ (the last two columns above, plus MariaDB which mirrors MySQL's shape). On PostgreSQL
you'll see `… admin database (postgres). Underlying error: 42501: permission denied to create database`;
on MySQL and MariaDB `… admin database (information_schema). Underlying error: Access denied … to
database 'fleet_tenant_006'`.

A reader/writer principal without the create right lands here — with a message that names the database and
the missing privilege, not a mystery failure. The deploy account needs rights for *every* action the tool
takes, reads included: it validates the server by querying the catalog before it provisions anything, so
an account too restricted to even read the fleet fails at that earlier gate. The principal shown here can
read the fleet but can't create — the realistic reader-without-`CREATE` case.

## Step 6: Do it on PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB

Same five steps in `postgres/`, `mysql/`, and `mariadb/`. The `CreateIfMissing` config is identical on
all four engines; only the create DDL SchemaSmith emits differs (`[fleet_tenant_006]` on SQL Server,
`"fleet_tenant_006"` on PostgreSQL, `` `fleet_tenant_006` `` on MySQL and MariaDB). Each one skips by
default, dry-runs, provisions + forges in one run, re-runs clean, and fails fast without the create
grant.

## Cleanup

Drop `fleet_tenant_006` on each engine to return to the five-tenant baseline:

```bash
cd ..            # back to the lab folder
../lab-sql.sh sqlserver master "ALTER DATABASE [fleet_tenant_006] SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE; DROP DATABASE [fleet_tenant_006]"
../lab-sql.sh postgres postgres "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS fleet_tenant_006"
../lab-sql.sh mysql information_schema "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS fleet_tenant_006"
../lab-sql.sh mariadb information_schema "DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS fleet_tenant_006"
```

## The principle

Module 1 discovered the fleet; Module 2 let config steer it; Module 3 lets config *grow* it. Onboarding a
tenant is no longer a database task plus a deploy task — it's one line in a roster and one run, with a dry
run when you want it and a clear stop when the account isn't allowed. That's the fleet operating itself.

Next: **Module 4** — running a thousand-tenant deploy safely: preview the whole roster, tune how hard it
hits, and keep going when a single tenant misbehaves.
