/// The rebuild DECISION point on PostgreSQL: which tables ModifiedTableQuench elects for a rebuild, and
/// -- far more important -- which it must not. RebuildTableTests covers the rebuild engine itself; this
/// fixture covers the one thing that decides whether that engine is ever pointed at a user's table.
///
/// Everything here runs the whole "SchemaSmith"."TableQuench" path (parse -> missing -> modified -> indexes
/// -> foreign keys) rather than calling RebuildTable directly, because the decision only exists inside that
/// path and a test that reached around it would prove nothing about it.
///
/// ANTI-VACUITY. "Nothing happened" is the passing state for half of these tests, so every one of them has
/// to be able to tell "nothing happened" apart from "the test asserted nothing". Two devices do that:
///   * a LIVE-ONLY MARKER INDEX the package never declares. RebuildTable drops the old table whole and
///     re-creates nothing but columns, and no downstream pass re-adds an index the package does not carry,
///     so the marker surviving is proof the table was NOT replaced and the marker being gone is proof it was.
///   * the relation's OID, captured before and compared after -- a rebuild swaps in a different relation.
/// And every test asserts its preconditions, so a setup that silently failed to produce the drift under
/// test cannot read as a pass.
