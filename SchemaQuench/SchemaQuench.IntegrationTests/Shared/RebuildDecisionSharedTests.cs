/// The rebuild DECISION point on the MySQL family: which tables ModifiedTableQuench elects for a rebuild,
/// and -- far more important -- which it must not. RebuildTableSharedTests covers the rebuild engine
/// itself; this fixture covers the one thing that decides whether that engine is ever pointed at a user's
/// table.
///
/// Everything here runs the real parse -> missing -> modified sequence rather than calling RebuildTable
/// directly, because the decision only exists inside ModifiedTableQuench and a test that reached around it
/// would prove nothing about it. The upper-tier policy is set the way DatabaseQuench sets it -- session
/// variables, not parameters (MySQL has no default parameter values, so a parameter would break every
/// direct caller; @ss_capture_would_drop is the established precedent).
///
/// ANTI-VACUITY. "Nothing happened" is the passing state for half of these tests, so every one of them has
/// to be able to tell "nothing happened" apart from "the test asserted nothing". MySQL has no object id to
/// compare across a rebuild, so the device is a LIVE-ONLY MARKER INDEX the package never declares:
/// RebuildTable drops the old table whole and re-creates nothing but columns, and no downstream pass
/// re-adds an index the package does not carry, so the marker surviving is proof the table was NOT replaced
/// and the marker being gone is proof it was. Every test also asserts its preconditions, so a setup that
/// silently failed to produce the drift under test cannot read as a pass.
